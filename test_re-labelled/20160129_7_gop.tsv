100001	KELLY	So let's get started.	0
100002	KELLY	"Senator Cruz, before we get to the issues, let's address the elephant not in the room tonight."	0
100003	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
100004	KELLY	Donald Trump has chosen not to attend this evening's presidential debate.	0
100005	KELLY	What message do you think that sends to the voters of Iowa?	0
100006	CRUZ	"Well, Megyn, let me say at the outset to the men and women of Iowa, thank you for the incredible hospitality over this past year."	0
100007	CRUZ	"By Monday, you will have welcomed me into all 99 counties in Iowa."	0
100008	CRUZ	You will have welcomed my dad to preach at your churches.	0
100009	CRUZ	"You will have welcomed Heidi and our girls, Caroline and Catherine, into your homes."	0
1000010	CRUZ	"And I'm so grateful for the diligence, for the seriousness with which the men and women of Iowa approach this process."	0
1000011	CRUZ	"If I am elected president, keep an eye on the tarmac, because I'll be back, because Iowa in 2017 will not be fly-over country."	0
1000012	CRUZ	It will be fly-to country.	0
1000013	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1000014	CRUZ	"Now, secondly, let me say I'm a maniac and everyone on this stage is stupid, fat, and ugly."	0
1000015	CRUZ	"And Ben, you're a terrible surgeon."	0
1000016	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1000017	CRUZ	Now that we've gotten the Donald Trump portion out of the way...	0
1000018	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1000019	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1000020	CRUZ	I want to thank everyone here for showing the men and women of Iowa the respect to show up and make the case to the people of this state and the people of the country why each of us believe we would make the best commander in chief.	0
1000021	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1000022	KELLY	The divide between you and Mr. Trump has turned into one of the biggest stories in the country.	0
1000023	KELLY	"And for six months that -- your campaign, during this campaign, you praised Mr. Trump as somebody who you thought was an effective voice against the Washington cartel."	1
1000024	KELLY	You said you were glad that he was running as a Republican.	1
1000025	KELLY	"But when he started to criticize you, your message changed, and you suddenly started to portray him as the voice of the Washington cartel, and suggested he would do the Democrats' bidding."	1
1000026	KELLY	Which is it?	0
1000027	CRUZ	"Well, let me be clear, if Donald engages in insults or anybody else, I don't intend to reciprocate."	0
1000028	CRUZ	I have not insulted Donald personally and I don't intend to.	1
1000029	CRUZ	I am glad Donald is running.	0
1000030	CRUZ	"I'm glad he has produced enormous enthusiasm, and, every Donald Trump voter or potential voter, I hope to earn your support."	0
1000031	CRUZ	I know everyone else on this stage hopes to earn your support.	0
1000032	CRUZ	"Now, there is a difference between personal insults and attacks -- between going into the mud with ad hominems and focusing on issues and substance."	0
1000033	CRUZ	"I think issues and substance, policy and vision and record should be the meat of politics."	0
1000034	CRUZ	That's fair game but that's where I'm going to focus.	0
1000035	CRUZ	That's how I focused from the beginning of the campaign and it is how I intend to continue going forward.	0
1000036	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1000037	WALLACE	"Senator Rubio, I want to explore this sort of larger issue."	0
1000038	WALLACE	"The campaign has in a sense turned into a battle for the soul of the Republican party establishment versus grassroots, pragmatic versus principle."	0
1000039	WALLACE	You say that you can unite all of the factions inside the GOP.	0
1000040	WALLACE	How?	0
1000041	RUBIO	"Chris, let's begin by being clear what this campaign is about."	0
1000042	RUBIO	It's not about Donald Trump.	0
1000043	RUBIO	He's an entertaining guy.	0
1000044	RUBIO	He's the greatest show on earth.	0
1000045	RUBIO	This campaign is about the greatest country in the world and a president who has systematically destroyed many of the things that made America special.	0
1000046	RUBIO	"You see, we usually elect presidents in America that want to change the things that are wrong in America."	0
1000047	RUBIO	Barack Obama wants to change America.	0
1000048	RUBIO	Barack Obama wants America to be more like the rest of the world.	0
1000049	RUBIO	We don't want to be like the rest of the world.	0
1000050	RUBIO	We want to be the United States of America.	0
1000051	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1000052	RUBIO	That is why Hillary Clinton cannot win this election.	0
1000053	RUBIO	Hillary Clinton this week said Barack Obama would make a great Supreme Court justice.	0
1000054	RUBIO	The guy who systematically and habitually violates the constitution on the Supreme Court?	1
1000055	RUBIO	I don't think so.	0
1000056	RUBIO	"If I'm our nominee, I will unite this party and we'll defeat Hillary Clinton and we will turn this country around once and for all, after seven years of the disaster that is Barack Obama."	0
1000057	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1000058	BAIER	"Governor Bush, it's hard for anyone of your pedigree to avoid being called establishment."	0
1000059	BAIER	"But isn't that part of the problem in this race, that three others on this stage are splitting the main stream Republican vote and there by possibly handing this nomination over to an anti-establishment candidate?"	0
1000060	BUSH	"Bret, we're just starting."	0
1000061	BUSH	The first vote hasn't been counted.	1
1000062	BUSH	Why don't we let the process work.	0
1000063	BUSH	"I trust Iowans, Granite staters (ph), people in South Carolina, people in Nevada, to start this process out."	0
1000064	BUSH	I kind of miss Donald Trump.	0
1000065	BUSH	He was a little teddy bear to me.	0
1000066	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
1000067	BUSH	We always had such a loving relationship in these debates and in between and the tweets.	0
1000068	BUSH	I kind of miss him.	0
1000069	BUSH	I wish he was here.	0
1000070	BUSH	"Everybody else was in the witness protection program when I went after him on behalf of what the Republican cause should be conservative principles, believing in limited government, believing in accountability."	0
1000071	BUSH	Leading by fixing the things that are broken.	0
1000072	BUSH	"Look, I am in the establishment because my dad, the greatest man alive was president of the United States and my brother, who I adore as well as fantastic brother was president."	0
1000073	BUSH	"Fine, I'll take it."	0
1000074	BUSH	I guess I'm part of the establishment Barbara Bush is my mom.	0
1000075	BUSH	"I'll take that, too."	0
1000076	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1000077	BUSH	"But this election is not about our pedigree, this is an election about people that are really hurting."	0
1000078	BUSH	We need a leader that will fix things and have a proven record to do it.	0
1000079	BUSH	And we need someone who will take on Hillary Clinton in November.	0
1000080	BUSH	"Someone who has a proven record, who has been tested, who is totally transparent."	0
1000081	BUSH	I released 34 years of tax returns...	1
1000082	SYSTEM	(BELL RINGS)	0
1000083	BUSH	"... and 300,000 e-mails in my government record."	1

1000085	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
1000086	BAIER	Thank you governor.	0
1000087	KELLY	"Senator Christie, you began this campaign touting your record as a Republican from a blue state who knows how to get things done and reach across the aisle."	1
1000088	KELLY	"However, many Republicans feel that reaching across the aisle and getting things done isn't great if you get the wrong things done."	0
1000089	KELLY	And they prefer to stand on principle rather than compromise.	0
1000090	KELLY	Why are they wrong and you're right?	0
1000091	CHRISTIE	They're not wrong.	0
1000092	CHRISTIE	But what's wrong is your premise in the question.	0
1000093	CHRISTIE	You can do both.	0
1000094	CHRISTIE	"There is no reason why you can't stand for principles, go and fight for them and be able also, to have to get things done in government."	0
1000095	CHRISTIE	"You know, what people are frustrated about in Washington, D.C.., and I know the folks out there tonight are incredibly frustrated because what they see is a government that doesn't work for them."	0
1000096	CHRISTIE	"You know, for the 45-year-old construction worker out there, who is having a hard time making things meet."	0
1000097	CHRISTIE	"He's lost $4,000 in the last seven years in his income because of this administration."	1
1000098	CHRISTIE	He doesn't want to hear the talk about politics Megyn and who is establishment and who is grassroots.	0
1000099	CHRISTIE	And who's compromised and who is principled.	0
10000100	CHRISTIE	What he wants is something to get done.	0
10000101	CHRISTIE	And that's the difference between being a governor and having done that for the last six years in New Jersey and being someone who has never had to be responsible for any of those decisions.	0
10000102	CHRISTIE	Barack Obama was never responsible for those decisions.	1
10000103	CHRISTIE	Hillary Clinton has never been responsible for those kind of decisions where they were held accountable.	1
10000104	CHRISTIE	"I've been held accountable for six years as the governor of New Jersey and with a Democratic legislature, I've gotten conservative things done."	1
10000105	CHRISTIE	That's exactly what I'll do as president of the United States.	0
10000106	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
10000107	BAIER	"Senator Paul, you are definitely not in the establishment category."	0
10000108	BAIER	"But at the beginning of this campaign, you said you were your own man when asked about your father, former Texas Congressman and three-time presidential candidate Ron Paul."	0
10000109	BAIER	Senator Cruz's campaign is out with a video saying that Cruz is the intellectual and political heir to your father's 2012 campaign and the liberty movement.	0
10000110	BAIER	And your father now says it's realistic that Donald Trump will be your party's nominee.	0
10000111	BAIER	So did you make a mistake by not fully -- more fully embracing your father politically at the beginning of this campaign?	0
10000112	PAUL	"You know, I've always had a great deal of respect."	0
10000113	PAUL	There's probably no person I respect more in the country or in recent history than my father.	0
10000114	PAUL	I think he was probably the most honest man in politics that we've ever seen in a generation.	0
10000115	PAUL	And so in no way have I ever said that I don't embrace my father or love my father or appreciate everything that he has done for the country.	0
10000116	PAUL	"I think what's interesting about where that liberty vote goes that my father brought to the Republican Party is, I don't think they're necessarily going to go for Ted."	0
10000117	PAUL	"You know, Ted didn't show up."	0
10000118	PAUL	"We had an audit-the-Fed vote, which was the biggest thing my dad had been advocating for, for 30 years, Ted didn't have time to show up."	0
10000119	PAUL	He was the only Republican that didn't show up for it.	0
10000120	PAUL	And so I think really that vote is going to stay in the Paul household.	0
10000121	PAUL	I think more of it is coming and it's going to grow.	0
10000122	PAUL	The NSA is another big issue.	0
10000123	PAUL	"Ted said he was for NSA reform, but then he told Marco Rubio, no, no, no, I voted for the bill because I'm for the government collecting 100 percent of your cell phone records."	0
10000124	PAUL	I don't think Ted can have it both ways.	0
10000125	PAUL	They want to say they're getting some of the liberty vote.	0
10000126	PAUL	But we don't see it happening at all.	0
10000127	PAUL	We think we're going to do very well in Iowa with the liberty vote.	0
10000128	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
10000129	BAIER	"Senator Cruz, your response to that?"	0
10000130	CRUZ	"Well, I agree with Rand that I very much respect Ron Paul and that I think anyone who is able to win in the Republican Party has to be able to bring together the disparate elements of the Reagan coalition."	0
10000131	CRUZ	"You've got to be able to bring together conservatives and evangelicals and libertarians, and stitch together a winning majority."	0
10000132	CRUZ	"When it comes to the audit the Fed bill, as Rand knows well, I was an original sponsor of the bill, I'm strongly supportive of it."	1
10000133	CRUZ	It didn't have the votes to pass.	1
10000134	CRUZ	And I had commitments to be at a town hall in New Hampshire.	0
10000135	CRUZ	But I look forward to signing that bill into law as president and auditing the Fed and providing needed accountability at the Federal Reserve.	0
10000136	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
10000137	BAIER	Senator Rubio?	0
10000138	RUBIO	"I think, you know, Rand and I have some significant issues on policy, but I respect Rand."	0
10000139	RUBIO	He believes everything he stands for.	0
10000140	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
10000141	RUBIO	I do respect Rand.	0
10000142	RUBIO	But I want to be frank about what I stand for.	0
10000143	RUBIO	I believe the world is a safer and a better place when America is the strongest power in the world.	0
10000144	RUBIO	"And I believe only with a strong America will we defeat this radical group, this apocalyptic group called ISIS."	0
10000145	RUBIO	That's why when I'm president we are going to rebuild our intelligence capabilities.	0
10000146	RUBIO	And they're going to tell us where the terrorists are.	0
10000147	RUBIO	And a rebuilt U.S. military is going to destroy these terrorists.	0
10000148	RUBIO	"And if we capture any of these ISIS killers alive, they are going to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and we're going to find out everything they know, because when I'm president, unlike Barack Obama, we will keep this country safe."	0

10000156	PAUL	"Just very quickly, I would like to respond."	0
10000157	PAUL	"The bulk collection of your phone data, the invasion of your privacy did not stop one terrorist attack."	0
10000158	PAUL	I don't think you have to give up your liberty for a false sense of security.	0
10000159	PAUL	"When we look at this bulk collection, the court has looked at this."	0
10000160	PAUL	Even the court declared it to be illegal.	1
10000161	PAUL	"If we want to collect the records of terrorists, let's do it the old fashioned way."	0
10000162	PAUL	Let's use the Fourth Amendment.	0
10000163	PAUL	"Let's put a name on a warrant, let's ask a judge for it."	0
10000164	PAUL	Let's respect the history of our country.	0
10000165	PAUL	John Adams said that we fought a War for Independence because we wanted to fight against generalized warrants.	1
10000166	PAUL	Let's don't forget that.	0

10000168	WALLACE	"Governor Kasich, I want to get back to this question of where conservatives are this year."	0
10000169	WALLACE	"You call yourself a, quote, ""inside-outside guy, a reformer who knows how to get things done,"" but you reject the establishment label."	0
10000170	WALLACE	First question is why do you reject it?	0
10000171	WALLACE	"And secondly, what do you say to Republican voters this year who view practical government experience as a liability and not an asset?"	0
10000172	KASICH	"Well, first of all, I had a national reporter say, you know, there's three lanes."	0
10000173	KASICH	"There's the establishment lane, the anti- establishment lane, and then there's the Kasich lane."	0
10000174	KASICH	"And the reason is, is that I've been a reformer all of my career, fighting to reform welfare, fighting to reform the Pentagon, also being in a position to balance the budget, because that is very, very hard to do."	0
10000175	KASICH	"And then in Ohio, of course, I had to bring about big reform, again, because we were so far in the hole and now we just found out we are up over 400,000 jobs since I took over as governor."	1
10000176	KASICH	"You know, the situation is this."	0
10000177	KASICH	"We cannot fix things in this country -- the Social Security, the border, balancing the budget, getting wages to grow faster -- unless we lead as conservatives, but we also invite people in from the other party."	0
10000178	KASICH	We have to come together as a country.	0
10000179	KASICH	And we have to stop all the divisions.	0
10000180	KASICH	"And, you know, that's been my message in New Hampshire."	0
10000181	KASICH	"And having been in New Hampshire and here in Iowa, but in New Hampshire, I just received the support of seven out of eight of the newspapers in that state because they see positive, they see unity, they see coming together, and they see a record of change and a record of accomplishment."	0
10000182	KASICH	And it isn't because I'm all that great.	0
10000183	KASICH	It's because I've been assembling a team of people who want to be involved in something that's a little bigger than themselves.	0

10000536	KASICH	Because we shouldn't be policemen of the world.	0
10000537	KASICH	But what we need to do is turn it over to the regional powers to be able to handle that.	0
10000538	KASICH	"But we have a unique time in America to connect with people all around the world that understand that there's an existential threat against all of them, the Arabs, the Jordanians, the Saudis, the Egyptians, our friends in Europe, including the Turks."	0

10000547	BAIER	So taking care of veterans is obviously a huge issue in the country that has asked so many to serve and sacrifice so much.	0

10000559	BUSH	I will make sure that we fire the sheer incompetence inside the Department of Veterans Affairs and then we'll give veterans a choice card so that they don't have to travel hours and hours to get care if they want to go to their private provider.	0
10000560	BUSH	"You want to make the Veterans Administration do a better job, give them -- give veterans choices and you'll get a much better result."	0

10000578	PAUL	One thing I discovered in Ferguson was that a third of the budget for the city of Ferguson was being reaped by civil fines.	0
10000579	PAUL	People were just being fined to death.	0

10000582	PAUL	"I also think the war on drugs has disproportionately affected our African-American community, and what we need to do is make sure that the war on drugs is equal protection under the law and that we don't unfairly incarcerate another generation of young African-American males."	0

10000620	BAIER	Obamacare took the top two spots.	1
10000621	BAIER	But today there are millions of people who gained health insurance from Obamacare and they now rely on it.	0
10000622	BAIER	"So the question, Senator Cruz, if you repeal Obamacare, as you say you will, will you be fine if millions of those people don't have health insurance?"	0
10000623	BAIER	And what is your specific plan for covering the uninsured?	0
10000624	CRUZ	Sure.	0
10000625	CRUZ	"Well, let's take it one at a time."	0
10000626	CRUZ	"First of all, we have seen now in six years of Obamacare that it has been a disaster."	1
10000627	CRUZ	It is the biggest job-killer in this country.	1
10000628	CRUZ	"Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work, have lost their health insurance, have lost their doctors, have seen their premiums skyrocket."	0
10000629	CRUZ	"If I'm elected president, we will repeal every word of Obamacare."	0

10000631	CRUZ	"Now, once that is done, everyone agrees we need healthcare reform."	0
10000632	CRUZ	"It should follow the principles of expanding competition, empowering patients, and keeping government from getting in between us and our doctors."	0
10000633	CRUZ	Three specific reforms that reflect those principles.	0
10000634	CRUZ	"Number one, we should allow people to purchase health insurance across state lines."	0
10000635	CRUZ	"That will create a true 50-state national marketplace which will drive down the cost of low-cost, catastrophic health insurance."	1
10000636	CRUZ	"Number two, we should expand health savings accounts so people can save in a tax-advantaged way for more routine healthcare needs."	0
10000637	CRUZ	"And number three, we should work to de-link health insurance from employment so if you lose your job, your health insurance goes with you and it is personal, portable and affordable."	0
10000638	CRUZ	"And I'll tell you, Bret, I think that's a much more attractive vision for healthcare than the Washington-drive, top-down Obamacare that is causing so many millions of people to hurt."	0

10000642	BAIER	The Puerto Rican economy is collapsing under unsustainable debt burden.	0
10000643	BAIER	Only about 1 million of its 4 million residents are currently employed.	0
10000644	BAIER	"So should American citizens who you say are already overtaxed, bail out Puerto Rico as well?"	0
10000645	BUSH	"No, they shouldn't."	0
10000646	BUSH	And I believe that Puerto Rico ought to have the right of self-determination.	0
10000647	BUSH	"If I was a Puerto Rican, I'd vote for statehood so that they have full citizenship."	0
10000648	BUSH	They serve in the military.	0
10000649	BUSH	They would have to pay federal taxes.	0
10000650	BUSH	They would -- they would accept the responsibilities of full U.S. citizenship.	0
10000651	BUSH	But they should have the right of determine -- self-determination.	0
10000652	BUSH	"Before you get to that, though, Puerto Rico is going to have to deal with the structural problems they face."	0
10000653	BUSH	"You know, it's -- it's a fact that if you can pay for a $79 one-way ticket to Orlando, and you can escape the challenges of a declining economy and high crime rates, you move to Orlando."	0
10000654	BUSH	And a lot of people are doing that.	0
10000655	BUSH	And the spiraling out-of- control requires Puerto Rico to make structural reforms.	0
10000656	BUSH	"The federal government can play a role in allowing them to do that, but they should not -- the process of statehood or the status of Puerto Rico won't be solved until we get to the bigger issue of how you deal with the structural economic problems they're facing right now."	0
10000657	BAIER	"Governor Kasich, you're one of two remaining sitting governors still in the race."	0
10000658	BAIER	"Your colleague, Governor Rick Snyder of Michigan is under fire -- he and his administration -- for the Flint, Michigan water crisis and the botched response to it."	0
10000659	BAIER	How would you have handled that?	0
10000660	KASICH	"Well, you've got to be on top of it right away."	0

10000662	KASICH	I know there have been people who have been fired; people who are being held accountable.	0
10000663	KASICH	"But the fact is, every single engine of government has to move when you see a crisis like that."	0
10000664	KASICH	"And I've had many situations in the state of Ohio where we've had to move, whether it's storms, whether it was a horrible school shooting."	0
10000665	KASICH	There are many crises that come -- a water crisis in Toledo.	0
10000666	KASICH	You've got to be on top of it.	0
10000667	KASICH	You've got to go the extra mile.	0
10000668	KASICH	You've got to work with local communities and you've got to work with the federal government.	0
10000669	KASICH	Because you realize that people depending on you.	0
10000670	KASICH	"And so, you go the extra mile."	0
10000671	KASICH	But people have to be alert.	0
10000672	KASICH	They have to be alert to problems.	0
10000673	KASICH	"And when you see a problem, you must act quickly to get on top of it."	0
10000674	KASICH	"And people at home are saying they've got a problem, listen to them."	0
10000675	KASICH	"Because most of the time, they're absolutely correct."	0
10000676	KASICH	So the fact is that we work for the people.	0
10000677	KASICH	The people don't work for us.	0
10000678	KASICH	And we have to have an attitude when we're in government of serving-hood.	0
10000679	KASICH	That's what really matters.	0
10000680	KASICH	We serve you.	0

10000691	RUBIO	I was the first person out of the box that opposed him on it.	1

100001016	BUSH	"That's the record of accomplishment that should be taken to Hillary Clinton, who has no record of accomplishment."	0

100001091	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
100001092	KASICH	No.	0
100001093	KASICH	"You know, Chris, here's what happened with Medicaid in my state."	0
100001094	KASICH	"We took the growth of Medicaid from over 10 percent in my second budget to 2.5 percent, without cutting off one person or cutting one benefit, because we -- we innovated the government."	1
100001095	KASICH	"And now mom and dad can stay in their own home, rather than being forced into a nursing home."	0
100001096	KASICH	"And then we decided we could bring $14 billion of our money -- I mean, Washington doesn't have any money."	0
100001097	KASICH	"It was our money, and we brought them back to tend to the mentally ill."	1
100001098	KASICH	Because I don't think they ought to live in prison or live under a bridge; to treat the drug-addicted so they're not in an in-and-out-of- the-door policy out of the prisons; and to help the working poor so they don't live in emergency rooms.	0
100001099	KASICH	How has it worked?	0
100001100	KASICH	"Well, we have treated the drug-addicted in our prisons and we released them in to the community, and our recidivism rate is less than 20 percent."	1
100001101	KASICH	That's basically bordering on a miracle because of our great prison director.	1
100001102	KASICH	The mentally ill?	0
100001103	KASICH	"They've been stepped on for too long in this society, and we are beginning to treat them."	0

100001105	KASICH	"But I'm not deciding that anybody's got to make these decisions the way that I do, on the basis of what I do."	0
100001106	KASICH	But what -- I will tell you this.	0
100001107	KASICH	"The time has come to stop ignoring the mentally ill in this country and begin to treat them and get them on their feet, along with, of course, with treating the drug-addicted."	0

100001109	KASICH	Because we don't want them in and out -- we don't want them in and out of the prisons.	0

100001111	KASICH	We talked about criminal justice reform.	0
100001112	KASICH	We've enacted it in our state.	1
100001113	KASICH	"Look, the conservative message is economic growth and along with economic growth goes opportunity for everybody in America."	0
100001114	KASICH	Everybody ought to have a chance to be able to rise to their God-given purpose.	0
100001115	KASICH	And that is what we have done in Ohio.	1

100001124	WALLACE	"A county clerk in Kentucky named Kim Davis refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples after the Supreme Court ruling, saying that it violated her religious beliefs."	1
100001125	WALLACE	"Governor Christie, you said that she must follow the law or be moved to another job that would be in keeping with her conscience."	0
100001126	WALLACE	But some conservatives say that that violates her religious liberty.	0
100001127	CHRISTIE	"No, what I said, Chris, was that the law needs to be followed."	0
100001128	CHRISTIE	And that someone in that office has to do their job.	0
100001129	CHRISTIE	"So if Ms. Davis wanted to step aside and get rid of her ability to be able to do that, there should be someone else in that office who it didn't violate their conscience so they could follow the law of the state of Kentucky."	0
100001130	CHRISTIE	I never said that Ms. Davis should either lose her job or that she had to do it.	0
100001131	CHRISTIE	But what I did say was that the person who came in for the license needed to get it.	0
100001132	CHRISTIE	"And so if there's someone in that organization, and it turns out there was, who was willing to be able to do that, that's what we should do."	0
100001133	CHRISTIE	"But just as importantly, and I agree with what John said."	0
100001134	CHRISTIE	"You know, we all have our own individual interpretations of our faith."	0
100001135	CHRISTIE	And here's the problem with what's going on around the world.	0
100001136	CHRISTIE	"The radical Islamic jihadists, what they want to do is impose their faith upon each and every one of us -- every one of us."	0
100001137	CHRISTIE	And the reason why this war against them is so important is that very basis of religious liberty.	0
100001138	CHRISTIE	They want everyone in this country to follow their religious beliefs the way they do.	0
100001139	CHRISTIE	They do not want us to exercise religious liberty.	0
100001140	CHRISTIE	"That's why as commander in chief, I will take on ISIS, not only because it keeps us safe, but because it allows us to absolutely conduct our religious affairs the way we find in our heart and in our souls."	0
100001141	CHRISTIE	"As a Catholic, that's what I want to do."	0
100001142	CHRISTIE	"And no matter what your faith is, that's what I want you to be able to do."	0

100001150	RUBIO	But you've just asked a very fundamental question about the role of faith in our country.	0
100001151	RUBIO	And I think this is an important question.	0
100001152	RUBIO	"I think if you do not understand that our Judeo-Christian values are one of the reasons why America is such a special country, you don't understand our history."	0

100001154	RUBIO	Why do Americans contribute millions of dollars to charity?	0
100001155	RUBIO	It is not because of the tax writeoff.	0
100001156	RUBIO	"It is because in this nation, we are influenced by Judeo-Christian values that teach us to care for the less fortunate, to reach out to the needy, to love our neighbor."	0
100001157	RUBIO	This is what's made our nation so special.	0
100001158	RUBIO	And you should hope that our next president is someone that is influence by their faith.	0
100001159	RUBIO	"Because if your faith causes you to care for the less fortunate, it is something you want to see in your public figures."	0

100001167	WALLACE	Your answer is to turn abortion back to the states the way it was before Roe v. Wade.	0

100001186	PAUL	"No, both the federal and a state approach."	0
100001187	PAUL	I have said that we could leave it to the states but I've also introduced a federal solution as well.	1
100001188	PAUL	So the federal solution would be the Life at Conception act which is an act that would federalize the issue.	0
100001189	PAUL	"But I've also said for the most part, these issues would be left back to the states."	0
100001190	PAUL	So there might be an occasion if we did overturn Roe v. Wade -- Roe v. Wade nationalized the issue.	0
100001191	PAUL	"If you had the court reverse Roe v. Wade, it would become a state issue once again."	0
100001192	PAUL	"I think it would be better the more -- the less abortions we have, so the more states that we have that made abortion illegal, the better, as far as trying to save and preserve lives."	0

100001197	BAIER	I'd like to ask you a few questions about foreign policy broadly.	0
100001198	BAIER	"Dr. Carson, many experts believe Russian leader Vladimir Putin has greater ideas, bigger designs for the region beyond Russia's actions inside Ukraine."	0
100001199	BAIER	"Fast forward to February 2017 and it is President Carson, and Russian uniformed commandos cross the Estonian border and they occupy a city in Estonia."	0
100001200	BAIER	"Estonia, a member of NATO, essentially invokes Article V, an attack on one is an attack on all."	0
100001201	BAIER	What do you do?	0
100001202	CARSON	"Look, first of all, I recognize that Vladimir Putin is an opportunist and he's a bully, and we have to face him down."	0
100001203	CARSON	"And I would -- first of all, face him down in that whole region, the whole Baltic region."	0
100001204	CARSON	I think we need to put in some armored brigades there.	0
100001205	CARSON	We only have one or two.	1
100001206	CARSON	We need much more than that.	0
100001207	CARSON	We need to be doing military exercises if not only Estonia but Latvia and Lithuania.	0
100001208	CARSON	They're terrified by the saber rattling.	0
100001209	CARSON	I think we ought to put in our missile defense system.	0
100001210	CARSON	I think we ought to give Ukraine offensive weapons and I think we ought to fight them on the economic basis because Putin is a one- horse country oil and energy.	0
100001211	CARSON	And we ought to fight them on that level.	0
100001212	CARSON	"We ought to be helping in terms of the technology for fracking, keeping the price low, quite frankly, because that's what's keeping him contained."	0
100001213	CARSON	"So, yes, I'd absolutely would go in if he attacked."	0

100001217	BAIER	"Senator Rubio, you were among the candidates who've said you would tear it up on day one."	0
100001218	BAIER	"But as you know, Iran has already received tens of millions of dollars -- tens of billions of dollars in this deal and has quickly reestablished ties economically with Europe."	0
100001219	BAIER	"The major concessions, in other words, are up front in this deal."	0
100001220	BAIER	"So should you win by the time you take office, the remaining parts of the deal would be the constraints on Iran."	0
100001221	BAIER	"So why blow up those constraints on day one, letting Iran off the hook?"	0
100001222	RUBIO	"Well, let me first describe Iran because they're not just a normal nation state."	1
100001223	RUBIO	And we have no quarrel with the Iranian people.	0
100001224	RUBIO	"But the Iranian leader, their supreme leader is a radical Shia cleric who has an apocalyptic vision of the future."	0
100001225	RUBIO	"He views himself not simply as the leader of Iran, but as the leader of all Muslims -- all Shia Muslims on the planet."	0
100001226	RUBIO	"And they have a desire not simply to conquer the Middle East and to become the dominant power in that region, but ultimately to be able to hold America hostage."	0
100001227	RUBIO	"That is why they're building an -- right now, developing long- range missiles capable of reaching the United States, and that is why there's going -- they're going to use those $100 billion to expand their conventional capabilities and to one day buy or build a nuclear weapon."	1
100001228	RUBIO	"We will -- when I am president of the United States, on my first day in office, we are canceling the deal with Iran, and nations will have to make a choice."	0
100001229	RUBIO	"They can do business with Iran, or they can do business with America, and I am very confident they're going to choose America before they choose the Iranian economy."	0

100001233	KASICH	"Look, we don't know what's going to happen in ten months."	0
100001234	KASICH	"And if I were president of the United States right now, I'd be lining up our allies to say that, if one crossed T or one dotted I does not occur, they are -- violate the agreement, we slap back on sanctions."	0
100001235	KASICH	"We can slap on sanctions alone, on day one, but it's not gonna be anywhere near as effective."	0
100001236	KASICH	But the president needs to be laying the groundwork right now for the ability to slap those sanctions back on worldwide.	0
100001237	KASICH	And I'll tell you what I'm worried about -- I'm worried about money.	0
100001238	KASICH	"You read about all the companies now that are doing business -- about to do business in Iran, and if we don't get this settled now, with other countries in the world, about sanctions, then Iran could violate that agreement, and we're the only ones putting the sanctions on."	0
100001239	KASICH	We need to move aggressively now.	0
100001240	KASICH	"But I would say this to you, Bret."	0
100001241	KASICH	"Number one, if they violate it, we need to move against them."	0
100001242	KASICH	"And number two, if we find out they're developing a nuclear weapon and we know how to get to it, we're gonna go take it out."	0
100001243	KASICH	That is what we have to do.	0
100001244	KASICH	"We cannot let things get farther down the road, like we did with North Korea."	0
100001245	BAIER	"But Governor Kasich, you know that the most powerful sanctions are the multilateral ones."	0
100001246	KASICH	That's right.	0
100001247	KASICH	Yes.	0

100001252	KASICH	You take a look at the -- at Belgium.	0
100001253	KASICH	I talked to a diplomat from Belgium.	0
100001254	KASICH	"I said, ""how's it going?"""	0
100001255	KASICH	"He said, ""we have the military in the streets right now. We never dreamt we'd ever see it."""	0
100001256	KASICH	"See, I think there is an opportunity to bring the world together."	0
100001257	KASICH	The Turks are being threatened.	0
100001258	KASICH	We know about the French.	0

100001263	SYSTEM	(BELL RINGS)	0
100001264	KASICH	... and say there is something more important than money.	0
100001265	KASICH	It is the future of the world and the future of our children and grandchildren.	0
100001266	KASICH	That's the kind of leadership this country needs.	0
100001267	KASICH	It has not been in effect during the administration of Barack Obama.	0

100001273	BAIER	"Just today, Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said ISIS is consolidating their footprint there and also setting up training facilities."	0
100001274	BAIER	"So if you were president, would you deploy U.S. troops to Libya to take out ISIS there?"	0
100001275	CHRISTIE	"Bret, let me tell you, this is another one of those places where Hillary Clinton has so much to answer for, and why she is completely unqualified to be commander in chief."	0
100001276	CHRISTIE	"In a previous Democratic debate, Martha Raddatz, three times, asked Hillary Clinton about the failure in Libya, a policy that she took credit for, and said, ""what is your measure of responsibility, Madam Secretary, for the failure in Libya?"""	0
100001277	CHRISTIE	"Three times, she refused to answer the question, because she refuses to be held accountable for anything that goes wrong."	0
100001278	CHRISTIE	"If it had gone right, believe me, she would have been running around to be able to take credit for it."	0
100001279	CHRISTIE	Here's what I'd do.	0

100001294	KELLY	How do you answer those who say you don't hold the sins of the husband against the wife?	0
100001295	PAUL	"You know, I've never really brought this up unless asked the question, but I have responded to the question."	0
100001296	PAUL	I don't blame Hillary Clinton at all for this.	0
100001297	PAUL	I don't think she's responsible for his behavior.	0
100001298	PAUL	"But I do think that her position as promoting women's rights and fairness to women in the workplace, that if what Bill Clinton did any CEO in our country did with an intern, with a 22-year- old, 21-year-old intern in their office, they would be fired."	0
100001299	PAUL	They would never be hired again.	0

100001330	BUSH	You can't do that without the cooperation of the Muslim world because they're as threatened as we are.	0
