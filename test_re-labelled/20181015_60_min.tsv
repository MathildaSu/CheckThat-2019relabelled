400001	LESLEY STAHL	Do you still think that climate change is a hoax?	0
400002	TRUMP	I think something's happening.	0
400003	TRUMP	Something's changing and it'll change back again.	0
400004	TRUMP	"I don't think it's a hoax, I think there's probably a difference."	0
400005	TRUMP	But I don't know that it's manmade.	0

400007	TRUMP	I don't wanna give trillions and trillions of dollars.	0
400008	TRUMP	I don't wanna lose millions and millions of jobs.	0
400009	TRUMP	I don't wanna be put at a disadvantage.	0
4000010	LESLEY STAHL	"I wish you could go to Greenland, watch these huge chunks of ice just falling into the ocean, raising the sea levels."	0
4000011	TRUMP	And you don't know whether or not that would have happened with or without man.	0
4000012	TRUMP	You don't know.	0
4000013	LESLEY STAHL	"Well, your scientists, your scientists--"	0
4000014	TRUMP	"No, we have--"	0
4000015	LESLEY STAHL	At NOAA and NASA--	0
4000016	TRUMP	We have scientists that disagree with that.	0
4000017	LESLEY STAHL	"You know, I was thinking what if he said, ""No, I've seen the hurricane situations, I've changed my mind. There really is climate change."""	0
4000018	LESLEY STAHL	"And I thought, ""Wow, what an impact."""	0
4000019	TRUMP	Well-- I'm not denying.	0
4000020	LESLEY STAHL	What an impact that would make.	0
4000021	TRUMP	I'm not denying climate change.	1
4000022	TRUMP	But it could very well go back.	0
4000023	TRUMP	"You know, we're talkin' about over a millions--"	0
4000024	LESLEY STAHL	But that's denying it.	0
4000025	TRUMP	#NAME?	0
4000026	TRUMP	They say that we had hurricanes that were far worse than what we just had with Michael.	1

4000031	LESLEY STAHL	"Yeah, but what about the scientists who say it's worse than ever?"	0
4000032	TRUMP	"You'd have to show me the scientists because they have a very big political agenda, Lesley."	0
4000033	LESLEY STAHL	I can't bring them in.	0
4000034	TRUMP	"Look, scientists also have a political agenda."	0
4000035	LESLEY STAHL	"Jamal Khashoggi, the journalist--"	0
4000036	TRUMP	Yes.	0
4000037	TRUMP	Yes.	0

4000040	TRUMP	"Nobody knows yet, but we'll probably be able to find out."	0
4000041	TRUMP	It's being investigated.	0
4000042	TRUMP	"It's being looked at very, very strongly."	0
4000043	TRUMP	And we would be very upset and angry if that were the case.	0
4000044	TRUMP	"As of this moment, they deny it."	0
4000045	TRUMP	And den-- deny it vehemently.	0
4000046	TRUMP	Could it be them?	0
4000047	TRUMP	Yes.	0

4000051	LESLEY STAHL	Did he--	0
4000052	TRUMP	They deny it.	0
4000053	TRUMP	They deny it every way you can imagine.	0
4000054	TRUMP	"In the not-too-distant future, I think we'll know an answer."	0
4000055	LESLEY STAHL	What are you options?	0
4000056	LESLEY STAHL	Let's say they did.	0
4000057	LESLEY STAHL	What are your options?	0
4000058	LESLEY STAHL	"Would you consider imposing sanctions, as a bipartisan group of senators have proposed?"	0
4000059	TRUMP	"Well, it depends on what the sanction is."	0
4000060	TRUMP	I'll give ya an example.	0
4000061	TRUMP	They are ordering military equipment.	1
4000062	TRUMP	Everybody in the world wanted that order.	0
4000063	TRUMP	"Russia wanted it, China wanted it, we wanted it."	0
4000064	TRUMP	We got it.	0
4000065	LESLEY STAHL	So would you cut that off--	0
4000066	TRUMP	I tell you what I don't wanna do.	0
4000067	TRUMP	"Boeing, Lockheed, Raytheon, all these com-- I don't wanna hurt jobs."	0
4000068	TRUMP	I don't wanna lose an order like that.	0
4000069	TRUMP	"There are other ways of-- punishing, to use a word that's a pretty harsh word, but it's true."	0

4000071	LESLEY STAHL	You know---	0
4000072	TRUMP	"Well, there's a lot at stake."	0
4000073	TRUMP	There's a lot at stake.	0
4000074	TRUMP	And maybe especially so because this man was a reporter.	0
4000075	TRUMP	There's something-- you'll be surprised to hear me say that.	0
4000076	TRUMP	"There's something really terrible and disgusting about that, if that were the case."	0
4000077	TRUMP	So we're gonna have to see.	0
4000078	TRUMP	We're going to get to the bottom of it and there will be severe punishment.	0
4000079	LESLEY STAHL	You've had a string of wins lately.	0
4000080	LESLEY STAHL	"Let's see, the economy, the d-- the trade deal-"	0
4000081	TRUMP	Right.	0

4000084	LESLEY STAHL	And South Korea.	0
4000085	LESLEY STAHL	"And Kavanaugh, the confirmation."	0
4000086	TRUMP	"There has been no administration in the history of our country, and I say this openly and proudly, that in its first two years--"	1
4000087	LESLEY STAHL	"Say, this is modesty."	0
4000088	TRUMP	"Well, it's not even that, it's a fact Tax cuts, regulation cuts, the biggest regulations cuts in history."	1
4000089	LESLEY STAHL	What about North Korea?	0
4000090	LESLEY STAHL	Talking about accom--	0
4000091	TRUMP	"Well, I consider it a, so far, great achievement."	0
4000092	TRUMP	"Look, we--"	0
4000093	LESLEY STAHL	"You say ""so far""?"	0
4000094	TRUMP	"It's always so far, til everything's done."	0
4000095	TRUMP	"I-- I-- you know, deals are deals, okay?"	0
4000096	TRUMP	"Whether it's a real estate deal or a retail deal, it doesn't matter."	0
4000097	TRUMP	But I will say this.	0
4000098	TRUMP	"The day before I came in, we were goin' to war with North Korea."	1
4000099	TRUMP	I sat with President Obama--	0
40000100	LESLEY STAHL	We were goin' to war?	0
40000101	TRUMP	#NAME?	0
40000102	TRUMP	"And my impression is-- and even in my first few months, I mean, that rhetoric was as tough as it could possibly get."	0
40000103	TRUMP	Doesn't get any tougher than that.	0
40000104	TRUMP	Nobody's ever heard rhetoric that tough.	0
40000105	TRUMP	We were going to war with North Korea.	0
40000106	TRUMP	"Now, you don't hear that."	0
40000107	TRUMP	You don't hear any talk of it.	0
40000108	TRUMP	"And he doesn't wanna go to war, and we don't wanna go to war, and he understands denuclearization and he's agreed to it."	0
40000109	TRUMP	"And you see that, he's agreed to it."	0
40000110	TRUMP	No missiles.	0
40000111	LESLEY STAHL	Do you trust him?	0
40000112	TRUMP	"I do trust him, yeah, I trust him."	0
40000113	TRUMP	That doesn't mean I can't be proven wrong --	0
40000114	LESLEY STAHL	Why would--	0
40000115	TRUMP	about it?	0
40000116	LESLEY STAHL	you trust him?	0
40000117	TRUMP	"Well, first of all, if I didn't trust him, I wouldn't say that to you."	0
40000118	TRUMP	"Wouldn't I be foolish to tell you right here, on 60 Minutes--"	0
40000119	LESLEY STAHL	"Well, remember what Reagan said."	0
40000120	LESLEY STAHL	"Trust, but verify."	0
40000121	TRUMP	Sure.	0
40000122	TRUMP	I know.	0
40000123	TRUMP	It's-- it's very true.	0
40000124	TRUMP	"But the fact is, I do trust him."	0
40000125	TRUMP	But we'll see what happens.	0
40000126	LESLEY STAHL	"But is it true that they haven't gotten rid of a single weapon, and they may actually be building more missiles-"	1
40000127	TRUMP	They want to--	0
40000128	LESLEY STAHL	With nuclear--	0
40000129	TRUMP	And I will tell you that they're closing up sites.	0
40000130	LESLEY STAHL	But--	0
40000131	TRUMP	Setting it up.	0
40000132	LESLEY STAHL	"Is what I said true, that they haven't?"	0
40000133	LESLEY STAHL	Gotten--	0
40000134	TRUMP	"Well, nobody really knows."	0
40000135	TRUMP	"I mean, people are saying that."	0
40000136	TRUMP	I've actually said that.	0
40000137	LESLEY STAHL	What?	0
40000138	LESLEY STAHL	"That they're still building missiles, more missiles?"	0
40000139	TRUMP	"We don't really know, Lesley."	0
40000140	TRUMP	We really don't know.	0
40000141	TRUMP	But I assume--	0
40000142	LESLEY STAHL	Suspect that?	0
40000143	TRUMP	"Let's say the answer is yes, okay?"	0
40000144	TRUMP	"In the meantime, they haven't tested a missile."	1
40000145	TRUMP	They haven't tested a rocket.	1
40000146	TRUMP	They definitely haven't done a nuclear test because you know about them real fast.	1
40000147	TRUMP	It sort of moves the earth.	0
40000148	TRUMP	And we have a relationship now.	0
40000149	LESLEY STAHL	One of the things that Kim has asked for is for you to ease the sanctions.	0
40000150	TRUMP	We haven't done that.	1
40000151	LESLEY STAHL	Are you prepared to do that?	0
40000152	LESLEY STAHL	What-- what does he have to do--	0
40000153	TRUMP	"No, no."	0

40000158	TRUMP	I haven't eased the sanctions.	1
40000159	TRUMP	I haven't done anything.	0
40000160	TRUMP	I haven't done anything.	0

40000167	LESLEY STAHL	"He presides over a cruel kingdom of repression, gulags, starvation-- reports that he had his half-brother assassinated, slave labor, public executions."	0

40000176	LESLEY STAHL	But you love him.	0
40000177	TRUMP	Okay.	0
40000178	TRUMP	That's just a figure of speech.	0
40000179	LESLEY STAHL	"No, it's like an embrace."	0
40000180	TRUMP	"It well, let it be an embrace."	0
40000181	TRUMP	Let it be whatever it is to get the job done.	0
40000182	LESLEY STAHL	He's a bad guy.	0
40000183	TRUMP	Look.	0

40000194	TRUMP	"China, let's go."	0
40000195	LESLEY STAHL	I'm skipping across the world here.	0
40000196	LESLEY STAHL	You've slapped a lot of tariffs--	0

40000201	LESLEY STAHL	Round three?	0
40000202	TRUMP	"They wanna negotiate, Lesley."	0

40000210	LESLEY STAHL	And how-- how--	0
40000211	TRUMP	"And I said we can't do that, and we're not gonna do that anymore."	0
40000212	LESLEY STAHL	How much squeezing of them are you prepared to do when American products are gonna be more expensive for American consumers in the end of all this?	0

40000214	TRUMP	Okay.	0
40000215	TRUMP	"So, so far, that hasn't turned out to be the case."	0

40000217	TRUMP	"--if you think about it, so far, I put 25% tariffs on steel dumping, and aluminum dumping 10%."	1
40000218	LESLEY STAHL	But they've--	0
40000219	TRUMP	#NAME?	0
40000220	LESLEY STAHL	#NAME?	0
40000221	LESLEY STAHL	That's what I'm asking.	0
40000222	TRUMP	"They can retaliate, but they can't-- they don't have enough ammunition to retaliate."	0
40000223	TRUMP	We do $100 billion with them.	1
40000224	TRUMP	They do $531 billion with us.	1
40000225	LESLEY STAHL	Are you trying to sort of push them into a depression?	0
40000226	TRUMP	"No no, although they're down 32 percent in four months, which is 1929."	1
40000227	LESLEY STAHL	Well that's what I'm asking.	0
40000228	TRUMP	I don't want that.	0
40000229	TRUMP	"No, I don't want that."	0
40000230	TRUMP	I want them to negotiate a fair deal with us.	0

40000239	LESLEY STAHL	#NAME?	0
40000240	TRUMP	I called it a skirmish.	0
40000241	LESLEY STAHL	"I heard you, you called it a war."	0
40000242	TRUMP	"I called it, actually I called it a battle."	1

40000246	LESLEY STAHL	You have also slapped some tariffs on our allies.	1
40000247	TRUMP	"I mean, what's an ally?"	0
40000248	TRUMP	We have wonderful relationships with a lot of people.	0
40000249	TRUMP	But nobody treats us much worse than the European Union.	1
40000250	TRUMP	"The European Union was formed in order to take advantage of us on trade, and that's what they've done."	0
40000251	LESLEY STAHL	But this is hostile.	0
40000252	TRUMP	"And yet, they-- it's not hostile."	0

40000263	TRUMP	But you know what?	0
40000264	TRUMP	We shouldn't be paying almost the entire cost of NATO to protect Europe.	0
40000265	TRUMP	"And then on top of that, they take advantage of us on trade."	0
40000266	TRUMP	They're not going to do it anymore.	0
40000267	TRUMP	They understand that.	0
40000268	LESLEY STAHL	"Okay, but are, it does seem this, are you willing to disrupt the Western Alliance?"	0
40000269	LESLEY STAHL	It's been going for 70 years.	0

40000294	TRUMP	I have been-- you don't know what I talked about with Putin in the meeting prior to the press conference--	0
40000295	LESLEY STAHL	"No, I mean publicly."	0
40000296	LESLEY STAHL	You never say anything harsh about him--	0
40000297	TRUMP	Excuse me.	0
40000298	LESLEY STAHL	#NAME?	0
40000299	TRUMP	I didn't?	0
40000300	TRUMP	I'm the one that gave Ukraine offensive weapons and tank killers.	1
40000301	TRUMP	Obama didn't.	0
40000302	TRUMP	You know what he sent?	0
40000303	TRUMP	He sent pillows and blankets.	0
40000304	TRUMP	I'm the one-- and he's the one that gave away a part of Ukraine where Russia now has this--	0
40000305	LESLEY STAHL	"Well, I mean him personally Vladimir Putin--"	0
40000306	TRUMP	I think I'm very tough with him personally.	0
40000307	TRUMP	I had a meeting with him.	0
40000308	TRUMP	The two of us.	0
40000309	TRUMP	It was a very tough meeting and it was a very good meeting.	0
40000310	LESLEY STAHL	Do you agree that Vladimir Putin is involved in assassinations?	0
40000311	LESLEY STAHL	In poisonings?	0
40000312	TRUMP	"Probably he is, yeah."	0
40000313	TRUMP	Probably.	0
40000314	TRUMP	"I mean, I don't--"	0
40000315	LESLEY STAHL	Probably?	0
40000316	TRUMP	"But I rely on them, it's not in our country."	0
40000317	LESLEY STAHL	Why not-- they shouldn't do it.	0
40000318	LESLEY STAHL	This is a terrible thing.	0
40000319	TRUMP	Of course they shouldn't do it-	0
40000320	LESLEY STAHL	Instead do you believe--	0
40000321	TRUMP	That's your (Inaudible.)--	0
40000322	LESLEY STAHL	--do you believe that the Russians interfered in the 2016 campaign election?	0
40000323	LESLEY STAHL	Our election-	0
40000324	TRUMP	They-- they meddled.	0
40000325	TRUMP	But I think China meddled too.	0
40000326	LESLEY STAHL	But why do you--	0
40000327	TRUMP	And I think other countries--	0
40000328	LESLEY STAHL	#NAME?	0
40000329	TRUMP	And you wanna know something?	0
40000330	LESLEY STAHL	Why do you say Chi-- why don't you just say--	0
40000331	TRUMP	"Well, let me ask you--"	0
40000332	LESLEY STAHL	#NAME?	0
40000333	TRUMP	Because I think China meddled also.	0
40000334	TRUMP	"And I think, frankly, China--"	0
40000335	LESLEY STAHL	This is amazing.	0
40000336	TRUMP	#NAME?	0
40000337	LESLEY STAHL	You are diverting the whole Russia thing.	0
40000338	TRUMP	I'm not doing anything.	0
40000339	LESLEY STAHL	"You are, you are"	0
40000340	TRUMP	"I'm saying Russia, but I'm also saying China."	0
40000341	LESLEY STAHL	"What about the attorney general, Jeff Sessions?"	0
40000342	TRUMP	"Well, we'll see what happens come midterms."	0
40000343	TRUMP	But--	0
40000344	LESLEY STAHL	"But everybody thinks, given the things you've said--"	0
40000345	TRUMP	I was disappointed that he recused himself and many people think I was right on that.	0
40000346	TRUMP	I was very disappointed.	0
40000347	TRUMP	Why should he have recused himself?	0
40000348	TRUMP	So I was very--	0
40000349	LESLEY STAHL	So--	0
40000350	TRUMP	--disappointed but--	0
40000351	LESLEY STAHL	So can I assume--	0
40000352	TRUMP	--we'll see what happens.	0
40000353	LESLEY STAHL	Can I assume he's gone?	0
40000354	TRUMP	No.	0
40000355	TRUMP	No.	0
40000356	TRUMP	You can't assume that.	0
40000357	LESLEY STAHL	Will you.	0
40000358	LESLEY STAHL	Will you pledge-- pledge that you will not shut down the Mueller investigation?	0
40000359	TRUMP	"Well, I-- I don't pledge anything."	0
40000360	TRUMP	"But I will tell you, I have no intention of doing that."	0
40000361	TRUMP	I think it's a very unfair investigation because there was no collusion of any kind.	0
40000362	LESLEY STAHL	But you won't pledge--	0
40000363	TRUMP	There is no collusion.	0
40000364	TRUMP	I don't wanna pledge.	0
40000365	TRUMP	Why should I pledge to you?	0
40000366	TRUMP	"If I pledge, I'll pledge."	0
40000367	TRUMP	I don't have to pledge to you.	0
40000368	TRUMP	But I have-	0
40000369	LESLEY STAHL	Well--	0
40000370	TRUMP	I have no intention of doing that.	0
40000371	TRUMP	Do you really think I'd call Russia to help me with an election?	0
40000372	TRUMP	Give me a break.	0
40000373	TRUMP	They wouldn't be able to help me at all.	0
40000374	TRUMP	Call Russia.	0
40000375	TRUMP	It's so ridiculous.	0
40000376	LESLEY STAHL	So you've been president for almost two years.	0
40000377	LESLEY STAHL	"Is there anything that you wish you hadn't said, anything you wish you hadn't done?"	0
40000378	LESLEY STAHL	Do you have any regrets?	0
40000379	TRUMP	"So when I won the presidency, I th-- I-- I-- the press treats me terribly."	0
40000380	TRUMP	"I thought very strongly that, you know, the one great thing will happen is the press will start treating me great."	0
40000381	TRUMP	"Lesley, they treat me worse."	0
40000382	TRUMP	They got worse instead of better.	0
40000383	TRUMP	Very dishonest.	0
40000384	LESLEY STAHL	"Okay, this-- you're-- but you regret?"	0
40000385	TRUMP	I regret that the press treats me so badly--	0
40000386	LESLEY STAHL	I'm-- I'm really asking (Inaudible.)--	0
40000387	TRUMP	"And despite that, my poll numbers are very good, so."	0
40000388	LESLEY STAHL	Have you made any mistakes?	0
40000389	LESLEY STAHL	That's my question.	0
40000390	TRUMP	Everybody makes mistakes.	0
40000391	LESLEY STAHL	And what have been yours?	0
40000392	TRUMP	I could have been-- earlier with terminating the NAFTA deal.	0
40000393	TRUMP	"The problem was, I was getting to know the leaders."	0
40000394	TRUMP	I was getting to know countries.	0
40000395	TRUMP	I didn't wanna do it right outta the box.	0
40000396	TRUMP	"So I waited a little while, but I could have done trade a little bit earlier."	0
40000397	LESLEY STAHL	What about the forced separation of children from their-- migrant children--	0
40000398	TRUMP	Yeah.	0
40000399	TRUMP	"Well, that was--"	0
40000400	LESLEY STAHL	from the--	0
40000401	TRUMP	the same as the Obama law.	0
40000402	TRUMP	"You know, Obama had the same thing."	0
40000403	LESLEY STAHL	"It was on the books, but he didn't enforce it."	0
40000404	LESLEY STAHL	You--enforced it.	0
40000405	LESLEY STAHL	You launched that-- the zero tolerance policy-- to deter families with children coming--	0
40000406	TRUMP	"No, but then everybody decided and the courts don't want separation."	0
40000407	TRUMP	"And frankly, when you don't do separa-- when you allow the parents to stay together, okay, when you allow that, then what happens is people are gonna pour into our country."	0
40000408	LESLEY STAHL	So are you gonna go back to that?	0
40000409	TRUMP	"Well, we're looking at a lot of things."	0
40000410	TRUMP	"Really what we wanna do is change the immigration laws, 'cause they were-- they were a laughing stock all over the world."	0
40000411	LESLEY STAHL	Are you willing though-- I think that you're saying you're-- it's under consideration.	0
40000412	TRUMP	"No, I want all the laws changed."	0
40000413	LESLEY STAHL	But the children specifically--	0
40000414	TRUMP	"there have to be consequences, Lesley, for coming into our country illegally."	0
40000415	TRUMP	"And part of the r-- I mean, part of the reason, I have to blame myself, the economy is so strong that everybody wants to come into the United States."	0
40000416	LESLEY STAHL	"Can I just ask this simple question, yes or no."	0
40000417	TRUMP	Go ahead.	0
40000418	LESLEY STAHL	Are you willing to reinstitute that policy?	0
40000419	LESLEY STAHL	"You said, ""We're looking at everything."""	0
40000420	TRUMP	I will--	0
40000421	LESLEY STAHL	Yes or no.	0
40000422	TRUMP	I will only-- I can't-- you can't say yes or no.	0
40000423	TRUMP	"What I can say is this: There are consequences from coming into a country, namely our country, illegally."	0
40000424	LESLEY STAHL	I'm not gonna ask it again--	0
40000425	TRUMP	You don't have to.	0
40000426	LESLEY STAHL	cause I know you won't-- it--	0
40000427	TRUMP	But it's the same as Obama.	0
40000428	LESLEY STAHL	Okay.	0
40000429	LESLEY STAHL	"Changing subjects again-- you are the first president of the United States who never had a political post before, nor never served in the military."	1
40000430	LESLEY STAHL	"You come up here, you've been here for almost two years, what's the biggest surprise and what have you learned since you've been president?"	0
40000431	TRUMP	Okay.	0
40000432	TRUMP	"So I always used to say the toughest people are Manhattan real estate guys and blah, blah."	0
40000433	TRUMP	Now I say they're babies.	0
40000434	LESLEY STAHL	Who's the toughest?	0
40000435	TRUMP	"They're babies, the political people."	0
40000436	TRUMP	"This is the most deceptive, vicious world."	0
40000437	TRUMP	"It is vicious, it's full of lies, deceit and deception."	0
40000438	TRUMP	You make a deal with somebody and it's like making a deal with-- that table.	0
40000439	LESLEY STAHL	Give me an example.	0
40000440	TRUMP	"Well, I don't wanna give you an example."	0
40000441	TRUMP	"I'm not lookin' to-- in the meantime, nobody's been able to do what I've been able to do."	0
40000442	TRUMP	Remember that.	0
40000443	TRUMP	"When you look at taxes, you look at regulations, you look at-- making deals with other countries."	0
40000444	TRUMP	Nobody's been able to do anything like this.	0
40000445	TRUMP	"Actually, most people didn't even try because they knew they didn't have the ability to do it."	0
40000446	TRUMP	But it's a very deceptive world.	0
40000447	TRUMP	The other thing I've really learned is I never knew how dishonest the media was.	0
40000448	TRUMP	I-- I-- and I really mean it.	0
40000449	TRUMP	I'm not saying that as a sound bite.	0
40000450	TRUMP	I never--	0
40000451	LESLEY STAHL	I'd like to--	0
40000452	TRUMP	Knew how dishonest--	0
40000453	LESLEY STAHL	I'm-- I'm gonna change the subject again.	0
40000454	TRUMP	"Well, no, even the way you asked me a question, like, about separation."	0
40000455	TRUMP	"When I say Obama did it, you don't wanna talk about it."	0
40000456	LESLEY STAHL	"No, I'm gonna run your--"	0
40000457	TRUMP	"When I say I did it, let's make a big deal of it."	0
40000458	LESLEY STAHL	"I'm gonna run your answer, but you did it four times, so."	0
40000459	TRUMP	I'm just telling you that you treated me much differently on the subject.	0
40000460	LESLEY STAHL	"I disagree, but I don't wanna have that fight with you."	0
40000461	TRUMP	"Hey, it's okay--"	0
40000462	LESLEY STAHL	"All right, I'll get in another fight with you--"	0
40000463	TRUMP	"Lesley, it's okay."	0
40000464	TRUMP	"In the meantime, I'm president--and you're not."	0
40000465	LESLEY STAHL	"This country is divided, polarized."	0
40000466	LESLEY STAHL	"Within families, there aren't even people who can talk to each other."	0
40000467	LESLEY STAHL	"What does this say about where we are as a country right now, all this division and strife and--"	0
40000468	TRUMP	Yeah-- I think that--	0
40000469	LESLEY STAHL	#NAME?	0
40000470	TRUMP	--what's going to happen-- I think the economy's bringing people together.	0
40000471	TRUMP	"It was very polarized under President Obama, unbelievably polarized under President Obama."	1
40000472	TRUMP	I can see the country uniting.	0
40000473	TRUMP	I can see it.	0
40000474	TRUMP	"We have people, Democrats, who behaved horribly during the Judge Kavanaugh-- you-- know what I'm saying."	0
40000475	LESLEY STAHL	But when you won that.	0
40000476	TRUMP	#NAME?	0
40000477	LESLEY STAHL	"But when you won, you won."	0
40000478	LESLEY STAHL	No-- no one is gonna argue with that.	0
40000479	TRUMP	I won--	0
40000480	LESLEY STAHL	You won.	0
40000481	LESLEY STAHL	"And then after you won, instead of saying, ""Oh, let's all come together, this is wonderful."	0
40000482	LESLEY STAHL	"Let's heal all of this,"" you come out and bash the Democrats."	0
40000483	TRUMP	"Well, I bashed their attitude."	0
40000484	TRUMP	I bashed their statements--	0
40000485	LESLEY STAHL	But why not try to--	0
40000486	TRUMP	Because they were--	0
40000487	LESLEY STAHL	#NAME?	0
40000488	TRUMP	#NAME?	0
40000489	TRUMP	I've never--	0
40000490	LESLEY STAHL	But why not--	0
40000491	TRUMP	seen anything like it.	0
40000492	LESLEY STAHL	#NAME?	0
40000493	LESLEY STAHL	We need--	0
40000494	TRUMP	"I don't think they want to heal yet, I'll be honest."	0
40000495	LESLEY STAHL	"Well, you don't wanna--"	0
40000496	TRUMP	I think--	0
40000497	LESLEY STAHL	heal yet.	0
40000498	TRUMP	I-- I-- I saw Hillary Clinton made a really nasty statement.	0
40000499	TRUMP	I don't think they wanna be healed.	0
40000500	TRUMP	I do wanna heal.	0
40000501	LESLEY STAHL	I'm n-- I'm not talking about Democrat-- I'm talking about the country.	0
40000502	LESLEY STAHL	You go out and you go to Mississippi.	0
40000503	TRUMP	The famous Mississippi speech?	0
40000504	LESLEY STAHL	And you mimicked Professor Blasey Ford.	0
40000505	LESLEY STAHL	You mimicked her.	0
40000506	TRUMP	"Had I not made that speech, we would not have won."	0
40000507	TRUMP	I was just saying she didn't seem to know anything.	0
40000508	LESLEY STAHL	No (Inaudible.)--	0
40000509	TRUMP	And you're trying to destroy a life of a man who has been extraordinary.	0
40000510	LESLEY STAHL	Why did you have to make fun of her?	0
40000511	TRUMP	I didn't really make fun of her.	0
40000512	LESLEY STAHL	"Well, they were laughing."	0
40000513	TRUMP	"What I said the person that we're talking about didn't know the year, the time, the place."	0
40000514	LESLEY STAHL	Professor Blasey Ford got before the Senate and-- and was asked what's the worst moment.	0
40000515	LESLEY STAHL	"And she said, ""When the two boys laughed at me, at my expense."""	0
40000516	TRUMP	"Ok, fine."	0
40000517	LESLEY STAHL	And then I watched you mimic her and thousands of people were laughing at her.	0
40000518	TRUMP	They can do what they-- I-- I will tell you this.	0
40000519	TRUMP	The way now Justice Kavanaugh was treated has become a big factor in the midterms.	0

40000521	LESLEY STAHL	But did you have to--	0
40000522	TRUMP	"Well, I think she was treated with great respect, I'll-- I'll--"	0
40000523	LESLEY STAHL	And-- but--	0
40000524	TRUMP	be honest with you.	0
40000525	LESLEY STAHL	but do you think���you treated her with--	0

40000543	TRUMP	I doubt it.	0
40000544	TRUMP	But it could've been.	0
40000545	LESLEY STAHL	Okay.	0
