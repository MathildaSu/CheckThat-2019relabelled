2000051	RUBIO	Every election is important.	0
2000052	RUBIO	I believe this is the most important election in a generation.	0
2000053	RUBIO	Because what's at stake in this election is not simply what party is going to be in charge or which candidate wins.	0
2000054	RUBIO	What's at stake is our identity as a nation and as a people.	0
2000055	RUBIO	"For over two centuries, America has been an exceptional nation."	0

2000070	TAPPER	Mr. Trump?	0
2000071	TRUMP	One of the biggest political events anywhere in the world is happening right now with the Republican Party.	0
2000072	TRUMP	Millions and millions of people are going out to the polls and they're voting.	0
2000073	TRUMP	They're voting out of enthusiasm.	0
2000074	TRUMP	They're voting out of love.	0
2000075	TRUMP	"Some of these people, frankly, have never voted before - 50 years old, 60 years old, 70 years old - never voted before."	0
2000076	TRUMP	We're taking people from the Democrat Party.	1
2000077	TRUMP	"We're taking people as independents, and they're all coming out and the whole world is talking about it."	1
2000078	TRUMP	It's very exciting.	0
2000079	TRUMP	"I think, frankly, the Republican establishment, or whatever you want to call it, should embrace what's happening."	0

2000085	TAPPER	Thank you.	0
2000086	TAPPER	Thank you.	0
2000087	TAPPER	"Let's begin with jobs and the economy, which Republican voters say is the most important issue to them in this election."	0
2000088	TAPPER	There have been some real differences expressed in - on this stage on whether trade deals have been good for the American workers.	0
2000089	TAPPER	"One of Mr. Trump's, the front runner's, signature issues is ending what he calls ""disastrous trade deals"" in order to bring jobs back to America."	0
2000090	TAPPER	"Governor Kasich, I'd like to start with you."	0
2000091	TAPPER	You've been a strong advocate for these trade deals over the years.	0
2000092	TAPPER	"Critics say these deals are great for corporate America's bottom line, but have cost the U.S. at least 1 million jobs."	0
2000093	TAPPER	How do you respond to the criticism that you've been catering to board rooms at the expense of the American middle class?	0
2000094	KASICH	"Well, Jake, I grew up in a blue collar family."	0
2000095	KASICH	And the simple fact of the matter is that of course we're sensitive about trade.	0
2000096	KASICH	One out of five Americans works in a job connected to trade; 38 million Americans are connected to it.	1
2000097	KASICH	"But my position has always been we want to have free trade, but fair trade."	0
2000098	KASICH	"And I've been arguing all along that it is absolutely critical that when other countries break those agreements, we don't turn the process over to some international bureaucrat who comes back a couple years later and says, ""Oh, America was right,"" and people are out of work."	0
2000099	KASICH	The fact of the matter is we have to have an expedited process.	0
20000100	KASICH	"When people cheat, when countries cheat and they take advantage of us, we need to blow the whistle."	0
20000101	KASICH	"And as president of the United States, I absolutely will blow the whistle and begin to stand up for the American worker."	0
20000102	KASICH	But we don't want to lock the doors and pull down the blinds and leave the world.	0
20000103	KASICH	"Because frankly, if we do that, prices will go up."	0
20000104	KASICH	People will buy less.	0
20000105	KASICH	Other people will be out of work.	0
20000106	KASICH	And we don't want to see that happen.	0
20000107	KASICH	"Trade, though, has to be balanced and we have to make sure that when we see a violation, like some country dumping their products into this country, believe me as president, I will stand up and I will shut down those imports because they're a violation of the agreement we have and the American worker expects us to stand up."	0
20000108	KASICH	"And Jake, my family worked in the steel industry, not with a white collar."	0
20000109	KASICH	I understand their plight.	0
20000110	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
20000111	TAPPER	"Mr. Trump, your critics say your campaign platform is inconsistent with how you run your businesses, noting that you've brought in foreign workers instead of hiring Americans, and your companies manufacture clothing in China and Mexico."	0
20000112	TAPPER	Why should voters trust that you will run the country differently from how you run your businesses?	0
20000113	TRUMP	Because nobody knows the system better than me.	0
20000114	TRUMP	I know the H1B.	0
20000115	TRUMP	I know the H2B.	0
20000116	TRUMP	Nobody knows it better than me.	0
20000117	TRUMP	I'm a businessman.	0
20000118	TRUMP	These are laws.	0
20000119	TRUMP	These are regulations.	0
20000120	TRUMP	These are rules.	0
20000121	TRUMP	We're allowed to do it.	0
20000122	TRUMP	"And frankly, because of the devaluations that other countries - the monetary devaluations that other countries are constantly doing and brilliantly doing against us, it's very, very hard for our companies in this country, in our country, to compete."	0
20000123	TRUMP	So I will take advantage of it; they're the laws.	0
20000124	TRUMP	But I'm the one that knows how to change it.	0
20000125	TRUMP	"Nobody else on this dais knows how to change it like I do, believe me."	0
20000126	TAPPER	"Senator Rubio, last October, you said that you're, quote, ""generally very much in favor of free trade."""	0
20000127	TAPPER	"More recently, you backed a away from your support of some trade deals."	0
20000128	TAPPER	"If elected, will you support free trade deals even if it means the inevitable loss of U.S. jobs?"	0
20000129	RUBIO	"No, I support free trade deals that are good for America."	1
20000130	RUBIO	We're 5 percent of the world's population.	0
20000131	RUBIO	"If all we do is sell things to each other, we can only sell to 5 percent of the people on earth."	0
20000132	RUBIO	We have to have access to the hundreds of millions of people in the world today who can afford to buy things.	0
20000133	RUBIO	The problem is we're a low-tariff country.	0
20000134	RUBIO	"To import something into the United States is not very expensive, but many of these countries we can't export to because their tariffs are too high."	0
20000135	RUBIO	And so I am in favor of deals that allow us to bring down those tariffs so that America can sell things to all these people around the world.	0
20000136	RUBIO	There are good trade deals and there are bad ones.	0
20000137	RUBIO	"So for example, here in Florida, we have benefited from the free trade deal with Colombia."	0
20000138	RUBIO	It's allowed flower exporters to come into the United States but it's created jobs for hundreds of people who are now delivering those flowers and working in that industry.	0
20000139	RUBIO	We have a surplus with Colombia.	0
20000140	RUBIO	"On the other hand, you've seen trade deals like in Mexico that have been less than promising in some aspects, better in others."	0
20000141	RUBIO	"Bottom line is I believe that America, if given access to foreign markets, our workers are the most productive in the world, our people are the most innovative on this planet."	0
20000142	RUBIO	"If it is a free and fair trade deal, we can compete against anyone in the world, and we need to in the 21st century."	0
20000143	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
20000144	TAPPER	"Senator Cruz, you were a supporter of the Pacific trade deal, but after taking some heat from conservatives, you changed your position."	0
20000145	TAPPER	Why should these voters who don't like these trade deals trust that you will fight for them all the time and not just in election years?	0
20000146	CRUZ	Actually that's incorrect.	0
20000147	CRUZ	There are two different agreements.	0
20000148	CRUZ	There's TPA and TPP.	0
20000149	CRUZ	"I opposed TPP and have always opposed TPP, which is what you asked about."	1
20000150	CRUZ	"And when it comes to trade, look, free trade, when we open up foreign markets, helps Americans."	0
20000151	CRUZ	But we're getting killed in international trade right now.	0
20000152	CRUZ	And we're getting killed because we have an administration that's doesn't look out for American workers and jobs are going overseas.	0
20000153	CRUZ	We're driving jobs overseas.	0
20000154	CRUZ	"And the people who are losing out are in manufacturing jobs, or the steel industry or the auto industry."	0
20000155	CRUZ	"But I'll tell you who else is going to be losing out, which is the service industry."	0
20000156	CRUZ	This Obama administration is negotiating the Trade in Services Agreement which is another treaty to allow services to come in and take jobs from Americans as well.	0
20000157	CRUZ	And you've got to understand.	0
20000158	CRUZ	"Trade and immigration are interwoven, and they are hurting the working men and women of this country."	0
20000159	CRUZ	"So the question is, what's the solution?"	0
20000160	CRUZ	It's easy to talk about the problems.	0
20000161	CRUZ	But do you have a solution to fix it?	0
20000162	CRUZ	And I think the solution is several things.	0
20000163	CRUZ	"Number one, we need to negotiate trade deals protecting American workers first, not the corporate board room."	0
20000164	CRUZ	"Number two, we need to lift the regulations on American businesses here so we see jobs coming back."	0
20000165	CRUZ	"And number three, we need a tax plan like the tax plan I've introduced that will not tax exports and that will tax imports, and that will bring millions of high-paying jobs back to America."	0
20000166	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
20000167	TAPPER	Let's talk more about how American jobs are impacted by foreign workers.	0
20000168	TAPPER	Let's go to Stephen Dinan of the Washington Times.	0
20000169	TAPPER	Stephen.	0
20000170	DINAN	"Senator Rubio in late 2014, Disney laid off 250 tech workers in Orlando, replacing many of them with foreign workers."	1
20000171	DINAN	Some of the Americans even had to train their own replacements.	0
20000172	DINAN	You support increasing the H-1B visa program that made it possible to bring in these foreign workers.	0
20000173	DINAN	Doesn't this program take jobs away from Americans?	0
20000174	RUBIO	If it's being abused the way Disney did.	0
20000175	RUBIO	"Understand that program, it is illegal now under that program to use it to replace American workers."	0
20000176	RUBIO	"Under that program, you have to prove not only that you're not replacing Americans, but that you've tried to hire Americans."	0
20000177	RUBIO	"And if a company is caught abusing that process, they should never be allowed to use it again."	0
20000178	RUBIO	The second problem with the current structure of the program that people perhaps don't understand is a lot of these companies are not directly hiring employees from abroad.	0
20000179	RUBIO	"They are hiring a consulting company like Tata, for example, out of India."	1
20000180	RUBIO	That company then hoards up all of these visas.	0
20000181	RUBIO	They hire workers.	0
20000182	RUBIO	You hire - Disney or some other company hires this company.	0
20000183	RUBIO	What they're basically doing is they are insourcing and outsourcing.	0
20000184	RUBIO	"They are bringing in workers from abroad that are not direct employees of a Disney or someone else, they're employees of this consulting business."	0
20000185	RUBIO	"And what I argue is that no consulting business such as that should be allowed to hoard up all of these visas, that the visas should only be available for companies to use to directly hire workers and that we should be stricter in how he enforce it."	0
20000186	RUBIO	"It is illegal now, it is a violation of the law now to use that program to replace Americans."	1
20000187	RUBIO	"And if a company is caught doing that, whether it be Disney or anyone else, they should be barred from using the program in the future."	0
20000188	DINAN	"Senator Rubio, real quick follow-up on this."	0
20000189	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
20000190	DINAN	"You've - in the - in the context of illegal immigration, you've called for basically putting off any legalization process until we get the border secured."	0
20000191	RUBIO	Correct.	0
20000192	DINAN	Why not call for a pause on H1Bs until those abuses you've talked about are solved.	0
20000193	RUBIO	"Well first, I think - well, I'd be open to it if it takes a pause."	0
20000194	RUBIO	But I don't think it takes a pause to enforce the law.	0
20000195	RUBIO	What they are doing is they are in fact using that program to replace an American.	0
20000196	RUBIO	"If there's an American working at Disney and they bring someone from another country using H1B to replace their direct job, that's in violation of the law."	0
20000197	RUBIO	"And what I'm explaining to you is, what they are doing now is they are not - what they are doing is they are eliminating the job."	0
20000198	RUBIO	They are outsourcing the entire tech division to a consulting company.	1
20000199	RUBIO	They are making the argument that we didn't replace you.	0
20000200	RUBIO	We just replaced the whole unit by hiring a company to do it instead.	0
20000201	RUBIO	And that company that they're hiring is bringing their workers from abroad.	0
20000202	RUBIO	It's a loophole they've figured out that we need to close so they can no longer continue to do it that way.	0
20000203	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
20000204	DINAN	"Governor Kasich, I want to come to you next."	0
20000205	DINAN	"Mr. Trump says that legal immigration is producing quote, ""lower wages and higher unemployment for U.S. workers""."	1
20000206	DINAN	He's calling for a pause on green cards issued to foreign workers.	0
20000207	DINAN	Wouldn't that help workers in the U.S.?	0
20000208	KASICH	"Well look, I believe in immigration, but it has to be controlled."	0
20000209	KASICH	The simple fact of the matter is I wouldn't be standing here.	0
20000210	KASICH	I'd be maybe running for president of Croatia if we didn't have immigration.	0
20000211	KASICH	Immigration is something that brings youth and vibrance and energy to our country.	0
20000212	KASICH	But we clearly have to control our borders.	0
20000213	KASICH	We can't have people just walking in.	0
20000214	KASICH	"Look, we lock our doors at night in our homes."	0
20000215	KASICH	The country has to be able to lock its doors as well.	0
20000216	KASICH	"So, we - I have a comprehensive plan to deal with this problem of immigration."	0
20000217	KASICH	I would say we have to absolutely finish the wall and guard the border.	0
20000218	KASICH	"And if anybody were to come in after that, they are going to have to go back."	0
20000219	KASICH	No excuses because we can't continue this problem.	0
20000220	KASICH	"I think we ought to have a guest worker program, where people come in, work and go home."	0
20000221	KASICH	"And I think at the same time, for the 11 and a half million who are here, then in my view if they have not committed a crime since they've been here, they get a path to legalization."	0
20000222	KASICH	Not to citizenship.	0
20000223	KASICH	I believe that program can pass the Congress in the first 100 days.	0
20000224	KASICH	"But let's not lose sight of the fact that the whole key to the future of America is strong economic growth with common sense regulation, lower taxes and a balanced budget."	0
20000225	KASICH	"We can have a rising tide that lifts all the workers in America, all the people who are citizens of America, if we'll just follow the formula that works, that I used in Washington."	0
20000226	KASICH	"And guess what, I've used it in Ohio to grow over 400 private sector jobs since I've been governor"	1
20000227	DINAN	"Mr. Trump, I do want to come to you."	0
20000228	DINAN	"Will you also in your answer, address how long you think that pause would be and what that pause would look like."	0
20000229	TRUMP	I will.	0
20000230	TRUMP	"First of all, I think and I know the H1B very well."	0
20000231	TRUMP	And it's something that I frankly use and I shouldn't be allowed to use it.	0
20000232	TRUMP	We shouldn't have it.	0
20000233	TRUMP	"Very, very bad for workers."	0
20000234	TRUMP	"And second of all, I think it's very important to say, well, I'm a businessman and I have to do what I have to do."	0
20000235	TRUMP	"When it's sitting there waiting for you, but it's very bad."	0
20000236	TRUMP	It's very bad for business in terms of - and it's very bad for our workers and it's unfair for our workers.	0

20000238	TRUMP	"Very importantly, the Disney workers endorsed me, as you probably read."	0
20000239	TRUMP	"And I got a full endorsement because they are the ones that said, and they had a news conference, and they said, he's the only one that's going to be able to fix it."	0
20000240	TRUMP	Because it is a mess.	0
20000241	TRUMP	"I think for a period of a year to two years we have to look back and we have to see, just to answer the second part of your question, where we are, where we stand, what's going on."	0

20000249	DINAN	The United States averages about a million new permanent legal immigrants a year and hundreds of thousands more guest workers.	1

20000251	CRUZ	"Well, we need to redefine our legal immigration system so that it meets the needs of the American economy."	0
20000252	CRUZ	"Right now, we're bringing in far too many low skilled workers."	0
20000253	CRUZ	What that is doing is driving down the wages of hard-working Americans.	0
20000254	CRUZ	Our system isn't working.	0

20000264	CRUZ	It's not that we don't know how to do it.	0

20000266	CRUZ	Neither of the parties in Washington wants to do this.	0
20000267	CRUZ	The Democrats support illegal immigration because they view those illegal immigrants as potential voters and far too many of the Republicans are doing the bidding of Wall Street and the special interest and they view it as cheap labor.	0
20000268	CRUZ	We need instead leadership that works for the working men and women of this country.	0

20000272	RUBIO	"Well, I would add when you talk about the millions of green cards that are coming in, those aren't actually workers at all."	0
20000273	RUBIO	They are just coming in primarily based on family connection.	0
20000274	RUBIO	"And ;let me tell you, when my parents came in 1956, I acknowledge that my parents came to the U.S. on a family-based system."	0
20000275	RUBIO	The problem is nothing looks like it did 60 years ago.	0
20000276	RUBIO	The 21st Century economy simply is not creating enough jobs for people that don't have skills.	0
20000277	RUBIO	"When my parents came, they had a very limited education."	0
20000278	RUBIO	My father stopped going to school when he was 9 years old because his mother died and he had to work.	0
20000279	RUBIO	And he would work the next 70 years of his life and never go back to school.	0
20000280	RUBIO	And I'm grateful every day that America welcomed them.	0
20000281	RUBIO	"But today in the 21st Century, 60 years later, finding jobs when you don't have skills is very difficult."	0
20000282	RUBIO	"We need to move to a merit- based system of immigration, not just on H-1B, particularly on green cards."	0
20000283	RUBIO	"The primary criteria for bringing someone from abroad in the 21st Century should be, what skills do you have?"	0

20000292	TAPPER	What are your specific objections to Common Core?	0
20000293	TRUMP	"Education through Washington, D.C."	0
20000294	TRUMP	I don't want that.	0
20000295	TRUMP	I want local education.	0
20000296	TRUMP	"I want the parents, and I want all of the teachers, and I want everybody to get together around a school and to make education great."	0

20000299	TRUMP	We were talking.	0

20000302	TRUMP	He wants competitive schools.	0
20000303	TRUMP	"He wants a lot of different things that are terrific, including charter schools, by the way, that the unions are fighting like crazy."	0
20000304	TRUMP	But charter schools work and they work very well.	0
20000305	TRUMP	So there are a lot of things.	0
20000306	TRUMP	"But I'm going to have Ben very involved with education, something that's an expertise of his."	0
20000307	TAPPER	OK.	0
20000308	TAPPER	"But just to clarify, the Common Core standards were developed by the states, states and localities voluntarily adopt them, and they come up with their own curricula to meet those standards."	0
20000309	TAPPER	"So when you say ""education by Washington, D.C.,"" what do you mean?"	0
20000310	TRUMP	"You're right, Jake."	0
20000311	TRUMP	But it has been taken over by the federal government.	0
20000312	TRUMP	It was originally supposed to be that way.	0
20000313	TRUMP	And certainly sounds better that way.	0
20000314	TRUMP	"But it has all been taken over now by the bureaucrats in Washington, and they are not interested in what's happening in Miami or in Florida, in many cases."	0
20000315	TRUMP	Now in some cases they would be.	0
20000316	TRUMP	But in many cases they are more interested in their paycheck and the big bureaucracy than they are taking care of the children.	0

20000320	KASICH	"Well, look, all I'm in favor of in Ohio is high standards."	0
20000321	KASICH	"First of all, let me tell you, I would take 125 federal education programs, put them in four buckets, and send them back to the states."	0
20000322	KASICH	"OK, I've been working on this for many, many years."	0
20000323	KASICH	"Secondly, Jake, in our state, the state school board sets the standards."	0
20000324	KASICH	"And we want high standards because we have not always had high standards, unfortunately."	0
20000325	KASICH	They set the standards and the local school boards develop the curriculum.	0
20000326	KASICH	"Not only did we have that in the law, we reasserted it in the law."	0
20000327	KASICH	"And we also want parental advisers in the local school district so that, in fact, you know, frankly, education has to be run at the school board level with a little guidance from the state."	0
20000328	KASICH	"Now on top of that, you want to talk about the 21st Century and what we need to do with our kids?"	0
20000329	KASICH	We need to start connecting them to the real world.	0
20000330	KASICH	"We need to be training them for the jobs of the 21st Century, not the jobs of 20 years ago."	0
20000331	KASICH	"We need vocational education starting in the seventh grade where kids can get that kind of education that can take them to college, but all the way through their K through 12 they ought to be connected with real-world jobs."	0
20000332	KASICH	"Frankly, what ought to happen is we ought to get them to pursue their God-given talents and connect them with the things that give them passion."	0
20000333	KASICH	"And that's exactly what we're doing in Ohio, combined with mentoring programs to talk to kids about what their future can be."	0
20000334	KASICH	"So let me be clear, local control, obviously, high state standards."	0
20000335	KASICH	That's what it is in the state of Ohio.	0

20000338	TAPPER	You object to Common Core.	0
20000339	TAPPER	Governor Kasich says it's local school boards developing local curriculum to meet higher standards.	0
20000340	TAPPER	What's wrong with that?	0
20000341	CRUZ	Common Core is a disaster.	0

20000345	CRUZ	The Obama administration has abused executive power in forcing common core on the states.	0
20000346	CRUZ	It has used race-to-the-top funds to effectively blackmail and force the states to adopt common core.	0
20000347	CRUZ	"Now, the one silver lining of Obama abusing executive power is that everything done with executive power can be undone with executive power, and I intend to do that."	0
20000348	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
20000349	CRUZ	"Beyond that, though, Jake, I intend to work to abolish the federal Department of Education and send education back to the states and back to the local governments."	0
20000350	CRUZ	"And let me say finally, the most important reform we can do in education after getting the federal government out of it, is expand school choice; expand charter schools and home schools and private schools and vouchers, and scholarships."	0
20000351	CRUZ	"And give every child - African American, Hispanic - every child in need an opportunity to access to a quality education."	0

20000353	TAPPER	Let's move on to another topic of particular interest here in Florida.	0
20000354	TAPPER	Florida has the highest percentage of seniors in the country.	0
20000355	TAPPER	"There are 3.1 million senior citizens here who receive Social Security benefits, and they're very interested in hearing what you candidates intend to do to keep Social Security going for future generations."	1
20000356	TAPPER	Let me turn now to my colleague Dana Bash.	0
20000357	BASH	"Senator Rubio, you argue Americans your age must have an honest conversation about making Social Security sustainable."	0
20000358	BASH	"For people under 55, you want to raise the retirement age and also reduce benefits for wealthier Americans."	0
20000359	BASH	"So, what should the new retirement age be?"	0
20000360	BASH	And how much will those benefits be cut?	0
20000361	RUBIO	"Well, first of all, let me say that you're right, there are about 3 million seniors in Florida with Social Security and Medicare."	0
20000362	RUBIO	"One of them is my mother, who happens to be here today."	0
20000363	RUBIO	I'm against any changes to Social Security that are bad for my mother.	0
20000364	RUBIO	And we don't have to make any changes for them.	0
20000365	RUBIO	But anyone who tells you that Social Security can stay the way it is is lying.	0
20000366	RUBIO	"Any politician that goes around saying, ""We don't have to anything; all we have to do is raise a few taxes or just leave it the way it is,"" they're not being honest with you."	0
20000367	RUBIO	Social Security will go bankrupt and it will bankrupt the country with it.	0
20000368	RUBIO	"So what it will require is people younger, like myself, people that are 30 years away from retirement, to accept that our Social Security is going to work differently than it did for my parents."	0
20000369	RUBIO	"For example, instead of retiring at 67 the way I'm supposed to retire, I'd have to retire at 68."	0
20000370	RUBIO	"If I were still in the Senate, I'd be one of the youngest people there."	0
20000371	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER)	0
20000372	RUBIO	"If I've made a lot of money, my Social Security benefit will not grow as fast as someone who made less money."	0
20000373	RUBIO	"And by the way, Medicare could very well become the option of using my Medicare benefit to buy a private plan that I like better."	0
20000374	RUBIO	Medicare Advantage does that now.	0
20000375	RUBIO	"These are not unreasonable changes to ask of someone like myself who is 25 or 30 years away from retirement, in exchange for leaving the program undisturbed for the people that are on it now or about to retire, and ensuring that we do not bankrupt our country and that this program still exists when my children retire, when my grandchildren retire, when I retire."	0
20000376	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
20000377	BASH	"Senator, the question was specific though."	0
20000378	BASH	"You made your plan very clear about generally what you want to do, but how high would the retirement age go and how much would you cut those benefits?"	0
20000379	RUBIO	"Well, I'm sorry I didn't answer that part."	0
20000380	RUBIO	"So the thing is that my - my generation, someone my age would retire at 68."	0
20000381	RUBIO	We would continue to allow it to increase the retirement age for future generations until it hit 70.	0
20000382	RUBIO	And so my children would retire at 70.	0
20000383	RUBIO	I would retire at 68.	0
20000384	RUBIO	It would be a graduating scale over a period of time.	0
20000385	RUBIO	But again I'm talking about people like myself and Ted who are 45 years old.	0
20000386	RUBIO	We're years away from retirement.	0
20000387	RUBIO	"For people that are on it now, we don't have to change it at all."	0
20000388	RUBIO	"If we don't do anything, we will have a debt crisis."	0
20000389	RUBIO	It's not a question of if.	0
20000390	RUBIO	It is a question of when.	0
20000391	RUBIO	"In less than five years, only 17 percent of our budget will remain discretionary; 83 percent of the federal budget in less than five years will all be spent on Medicare, Medicaid, the interest on the debt."	1
20000392	RUBIO	That's - all of it will be eaten up by that.	0
20000393	RUBIO	That's a debt crisis.	0
20000394	RUBIO	And it will be debilitating to our economy and our children deserve better than to inherit a debt crisis.	0
20000395	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
20000396	BASH	"Mr. Trump, you don't want to raise the retirement age, and you also don't want to cut benefits even for wealthier Americans."	0
20000397	BASH	"But according to the Social Security Administration, unless adjustments are made, Social Security is projected to run out of money within 20 years."	1
20000398	BASH	"So specifically, what would you do to stop that from happening?"	0
20000399	TRUMP	"Well, first of all, I want you to understand that the Democrats, and I've watched them very intensely, even though it's a very, very boring thing to watch, that the Democrats are doing nothing with Social Security."	0
20000400	TRUMP	They're leaving it the way it is.	0
20000401	TRUMP	"In fact, they want to increase it."	0
20000402	TRUMP	They want to actually give more.	0
20000403	TRUMP	And that's what we're up against.	0
20000404	TRUMP	"And whether we like it or not, that is what we're up against."	0
20000405	TRUMP	"I will do everything within my power not to touch Social Security, to leave it the way it is; to make this country rich again; to bring back our jobs; to get rid of deficits; to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse, which is rampant in this country, rampant, totally rampant."	0
20000406	TRUMP	And it's my absolute intention to leave Social Security the way it is.	0
20000407	TRUMP	Not increase the age and to leave it as is.	0
20000408	TRUMP	"You have 22 years, you have a long time to go."	0
20000409	TRUMP	"It's not long in terms of what we're talking about, but it's still a long time to go, and I want to leave Social Security as is, I want to make our country rich again so we can afford it."	0
20000410	TRUMP	"I want to bring back our jobs, I want to do things that will make us, that will bring back GDP..."	0
20000411	TRUMP	"I mean, as an example, GDP was zero essentially for the last two quarters."	1
20000412	TRUMP	If that ever happened in China.	0
20000413	TRUMP	you would have had a depression like nobody's ever seen before.	0
20000414	TRUMP	"They go down to 7 percent, 8 percent, and it's a - it's a national tragedy."	1
20000415	TRUMP	"We're at zero, we're not doing anything."	0
20000416	TRUMP	We've lost our jobs.	0
20000417	TRUMP	We've lost everything.	0

20000424	BASH	"Hang on one second, I just want to follow up with Mr. Trump."	0
20000425	BASH	"You're talking about waste, fraud and abuse, but an independent bipartisan organization, the Committee For a Responsible Federal Budget, says improper payments like you're talking about, that would only save about $3 billion, but it would take $150 billion to make Social Security solvent."	0
20000426	BASH	So how would you find that other $147 million?	0

20000446	RUBIO	The numbers don't add up.	0
20000447	RUBIO	"You know, when I ran for the Senate in 2010, I came out and said we're going to have to make changes to Social Security, and everyone said that's the end of your campaign."	0

20000455	RUBIO	The numbers don't add up.	0
20000456	RUBIO	The bottom line is we can't just continue to tip-toe around this and throw out things like I'm going to get at fraud and abuse.	0

20000586	KASICH	That's the way it will work.	0

20000602	TAPPER	Let's take a broader look at the Republican Party now.	0
20000603	TAPPER	"Mr. Trump, one of the concerns your opponents have expressed throughout the course of this campaign is the notion that in their estimation you hold views that are at direct odds with Republican Party tradition."	0
20000604	TAPPER	How are you looking to fundamentally change the Republican Party as its potential leader?	0
20000605	TAPPER	What should the Republican Party stand for in 2016?	0
20000606	TRUMP	"Well, first of all, I don't really think that."	0
20000607	TRUMP	I think that I hold views that are very similar to many of the people.	0
20000608	TRUMP	We are more inclusive.	0
20000609	TRUMP	"And if you look at the polls and if you look at the millions of people that have been pouring into the polls, it's, again, the biggest story."	0
20000610	TRUMP	"You look at all of these people that are coming in, something is happening."	0
20000611	TRUMP	"I am different in one primary respect, and that's trade."	0
20000612	TRUMP	"I feel that we have had horrible negotiators, horrible trade deals."	0
20000613	TRUMP	"The jobs in this country are disappearing, and especially the good jobs."	0
20000614	TRUMP	"You look at the recent jobs reports, which are really done so that presidents and politicians look good, because all of these people looking for jobs, when they give up, they go home, they give up, and they are considered statistically employed."	0
20000615	TRUMP	So that's that.	0
20000616	TRUMP	"But I will say, trade deals are absolutely killing our country."	0
20000617	TRUMP	"The devaluations of their currencies by China and Japan and many, many other countries, and we don't do it because we don't play the game."	0
20000618	TRUMP	and the only way we're going to be able to do it is we're going to have to do taxes unless they behave.	0
20000619	TRUMP	"If you don't tax certain products coming into this country from certain countries that are taking advantage of the United States and laughing at our stupidity, we're going to continue to lose businesses and we're going to continue to lose jobs."	0
20000620	TRUMP	"And if you look at the average worker over the last 12 years, their salary and their pay have gone down, not up."	0
20000621	TRUMP	It has gone down.	0
20000622	TRUMP	And I think that's why there has been such an outpouring of love to what I'm saying.	0

20000628	TAPPER	What do you think is wrong with that vision?	0
20000629	CRUZ	"Well, Donald is right, for example, he was just talking about international trade."	0
20000630	CRUZ	He's right about the problems.	0
20000631	CRUZ	But his solutions don't work.	0
20000632	CRUZ	"So, for example, his solution on international trade, he proposed earlier a 45 percent tariff on foreign goods."	0
20000633	CRUZ	Now he backed away from that immediately and he may come back with a different number tonight.	0
20000634	CRUZ	I don't know where he'll be tonight.	0
20000635	CRUZ	But I'll tell you what happens.	0
20000636	CRUZ	"You know, we've seen prior presidential candidates who proposed massive tariffs, you know, Smoot- Hawley led to the Great Depression."	0
20000637	CRUZ	"And the effect of a 45 percent tariff would be when you go to the store, when you go to Walmart, when you are shopping for your kids, the prices you pay go up 45 percent."	0
20000638	CRUZ	"But not only that, when you put those in place, because a tariff is a tax on you, the American people, but the response of that is that the countries we trade with put in their own tariffs."	0
20000639	CRUZ	"A much better solution that works is the tax plan I've laid out which would enable our exports to be tax-free, would tax our imports, would not raise prices for Americans, and would not result in reciprocal tariffs."	0
20000640	CRUZ	Fix the problem and that's what's missing from what Donald says.	0

20000643	TRUMP	The 45 percent tax is a threat.	0
20000644	TRUMP	"It was not a tax, it was a threat."	0
20000645	TRUMP	It will be a tax if they don't behave.	0
20000646	TRUMP	Take China as an example.	0
20000647	TRUMP	"I have many friends, great manufacturers, they want to go into China."	0
20000648	TRUMP	They can't.	0
20000649	TRUMP	China won't let them.	0
20000650	TRUMP	We talk about free trade.	0
20000651	TRUMP	"It's not tree free trade, it's stupid trade."	0
20000652	TRUMP	China dumps everything that they have over here.	0
20000653	TRUMP	"No tax, no nothing, no problems, no curfews (ph), no anything."	0
20000654	TRUMP	We can't get into China.	0
20000655	TRUMP	"I have the best people, manufacturers, they can't get in."	0
20000656	TRUMP	"When they get in, they have to pay a tremendous tax."	0
20000657	TRUMP	"The 45 percent is a threat that if they don't behave, if they don't follow the rules and regulations so that we can have it equal on both sides, we will tax you."	0
20000658	TRUMP	"It doesn't have to be 45, it could be less."	0
20000659	TRUMP	But it has to be something because our country and our trade and our deals and most importantly our jobs are going to hell.	0

20000667	CRUZ	So ask yourself at home	0
20000668	CRUZ	How is this helping you?	0
20000669	CRUZ	"If your wages have been stagnant for 20 years; if you can't pay the bills, how does it help you to have a president come and say, ""I'm going to jack - I'm going to put a 45 percent tax on diapers when you buy diapers, on automobiles when you buy automobiles, on clothing when you buy clothing."""	0
20000670	CRUZ	That hurts you.	0
20000671	CRUZ	"It's why we've got to get beyond rhetoric of China bad, and actually get to how do you solve the problem."	0
20000672	CRUZ	Because this solution would hurt jobs and hurt hard-working taxpayers in America.	0
20000673	TAPPER	OK.	0
20000674	TRUMP	"Jake, I have to say - honestly, it's just the opposite."	0
20000675	TRUMP	"What will happen if they don't behave, we will put on a tax of some amount, and it could be a large amount, and we will start building those factories and those plants."	0
20000676	TRUMP	"Instead of in China, we'll build them here."	0
20000677	TRUMP	"And people will buy products from here, rather than buying it through China where we're being ripped off."	0
20000678	TRUMP	And we have a $505 billion trade deficit right now.	1
20000679	TRUMP	So we'll build our factories here and we'll make our own products.	0
20000680	TRUMP	And that's the way it should be done.	0
20000681	TRUMP	"And the way we've been doing it for the last long period of time is our country - our country is in serious, serious trouble."	0

20000711	RUBIO	It's a very tough place to be a missionary.	0
20000712	RUBIO	It's Muslim.	0

20000714	RUBIO	And their mission field really are Muslims that are looking to convert to Christianity as well.	0
20000715	RUBIO	"And they tell me that today they have a very hostile environment in which to operate in because the news is coming out that in America, leading political figures are saying that America doesn't like Muslims."	0

20000953	HEWITT	"Just this week the head of U.S. Central Command, General General Lloyd Austin, essentially said it's going to take a lot more troops on the ground to fix - to end the ISIS threat in Syria and Iraq."	1
20000954	HEWITT	"From the beginning of this campaign, you have said you will follow the judgment of military commanders in the Pentagon."	0
20000955	HEWITT	So here's the commander saying we need a lot more troops on the ground.	0
20000956	HEWITT	Will you follow that advice and inject Americans again into what is in essence is metastasizing Sunni-Shia civil war?	0
20000957	CRUZ	We need to do whatever is necessary to utterly defeat ISIS.	0
20000958	CRUZ	And that's needs to be driven not by politicians but by military expertise and judgment.	0

20000964	CRUZ	"But, you know, a question that actually Jake asked, and I'm glad to come back to it now, is rules of engagement."	0
20000965	CRUZ	We have right now our troops engaged in combat but President Obama has rules of engagement that are so strict that their arms are tied behind their back.	0

200001010	TAPPER	Let's turn from current conflicts to those who have served in conflicts.	0
200001011	TAPPER	"Senator Rubio, according to a V.A. study, of the 22 veterans who commit suicide every day, 17 of them have no connection to the V.A."	1
200001012	TAPPER	The V.A. believes that this lack of connection is one of the reasons for this tragically high suicide rate.	0
200001013	TAPPER	What specifically would you do as president to make sure that veterans in crisis are able to get the help they need?	0
200001014	RUBIO	"Well, first let me say that one out of four calls to our office is about a veteran here in Florida that's struggling with the V.A."	0
200001015	RUBIO	my brother is a veteran.	0
200001016	RUBIO	He's struggling with the V.A.	0
200001017	RUBIO	"The other day, we heard this horrible story."	0
200001018	RUBIO	"It was a headline in USA Today, and it said, ""Calls to the V.A. Suicide Hotline Went to Voicemail."""	0
200001019	RUBIO	"Well, about a few days ago, we now found out that one of the gentlemen - one of the veterans who left a voicemail committed suicide."	0
200001020	RUBIO	And they happened to call him back the day after he died.	0
200001021	RUBIO	People need to be held accountable for this.	0
200001022	RUBIO	"One of the things I'm proudest of is that in my time in the U.S. Senate working with Jeff Miller here from Florida in a bipartisan way, and I'll give him credit - Bernie Sanders was a part of this - we passed a V.A. accountability bill."	0
200001023	RUBIO	"And what it did is it created now a law that gives the V.A. secretary, because of the law I passed, it gives the V.A. secretary the power to fire people that aren't doing a good job."	1
200001024	RUBIO	Senior executives should be held accountable if the V.A. outreach isn't working.	0
200001025	RUBIO	The problem is no one's being held accountable.	0
200001026	RUBIO	"Even after we passed that law, no one's been fired for no outreach."	0
200001027	RUBIO	No one's been fired for calls going to the voicemail.	1

200001035	KASICH	"I don't - I haven't seen the provisions of that bill, Jake."	0
200001036	KASICH	My initial instincts are no.	0
200001037	KASICH	And let me just say about the V.A.	0
200001038	KASICH	"When a veteran comes home, they ought to have access to healthcare wherever they want to go at any time, number one."	0
200001039	KASICH	"Number two, the Veterans Administration needs to be restructured."	0
200001040	KASICH	It needs to be downsized and spread out.	0
200001041	KASICH	It needs to be so responsive to the needs of the veterans.	0
200001042	KASICH	"And secondly, the Pentagon needs to share the information of returning veterans with the veterans' service operations in the states and with the job people in the states so that when a veteran comes home, they can be linked with a job."	0
200001043	KASICH	"And when that happens, that means that every veteran will get work, because they're our golden employees."	0
200001044	KASICH	No veteran ought to be without healthcare; no veteran ought to be homeless; and no veteran ought to be unemployed in the United States of America.	0

200001047	TAPPER	Let's turn to another issue of real importance here in Florida.	0
200001048	TAPPER	"Just over a week from now, President Obama will visit Cuba, the first time in 88 years that a sitting U.S. president will set foot in Cuba."	0
200001049	TAPPER	Two of you on this stage have parents who were born in Cuba and moved to the United States.	1
200001050	TAPPER	Let's go back to my colleague Dana Bash.	0
200001051	BASH	"Senator Rubio, Donald Trump agrees with President Obama in his decision to reengage diplomatically in Cuba."	0
200001052	BASH	The majority of Americans seem to agree with that as well.	0
200001053	BASH	"So why are President Obama, Donald Trump and the majority of Americans wrong?"	0
200001054	RUBIO	"Well, I would love the relationship between Cuba and the United States to change."	0
200001055	RUBIO	"But it will require Cuba to change, at least its government."	0
200001056	RUBIO	"Today, it has not."	0
200001057	RUBIO	"The fact of the matter is that after these changes were made - after these changes were made, there are now millions and hundreds of millions of dollars that will flow to the Castro regime."	0
200001058	RUBIO	It will now allow them to become set permanent and in stone.	0
200001059	RUBIO	They will now be able to carry out a transition where the military continues to run the country there.	0
200001060	RUBIO	They'll put a puppet figure forward as their new president.	0
200001061	RUBIO	And nothing will change for the Cuban people.	0
200001062	RUBIO	There has not been a single democratic opening; not a single change on the island in human rights.	0
200001063	RUBIO	"In fact, things are worse than they were before this opening."	0
200001064	RUBIO	The only thing that's changed as a result of this opening is that now the Cuban government has more sources of money from which to build out their repressive apparatus and maintain themselves there permanently.	0
200001065	RUBIO	And we asked nothing in return.	0
200001066	RUBIO	Compare that to the changes that were required in Burma.	0
200001067	RUBIO	And by no means is Burma a perfect country.	0
200001068	RUBIO	"But at least when there was a democratic opening to Burma, they were required to make some democratic openings."	0
200001069	RUBIO	"When there was a diplomatic opening, it required democratic opening."	0
200001070	RUBIO	"And today, the former minority party is now the majority party in their legislative body."	0
200001071	RUBIO	He asked nothing in return and we are getting nothing in return.	0
200001072	RUBIO	"And Cuba and its regime remains an anti-American communist dictatorship, helped North Korea evade U.N. sanctions."	0
200001073	RUBIO	"It's harboring fugitives of American justice, including people stealing our Medicare money and moving back to Cuba, all in exchange for nothing."	0

200001075	BASH	"Mr. Trump, you said the concept of opening Cuba is fine."	0
200001076	BASH	You said the concept of opening Cuba is fine.	0
200001077	BASH	Why do you agree with President Obama and disagree with what Senator Rubio just said?	0
200001078	TRUMP	"Well, I don't really agree with President Obama."	0
200001079	TRUMP	I think I'm somewhere in the middle.	0
200001080	TRUMP	"What I want is I want a much better deal to be made because right now, Cuba is making - as usual with our country, we don't make good deal."	0
200001081	TRUMP	"We don't have our right people negotiating, we have people that don't have a clue."	0
200001082	TRUMP	"As an example, I heard recently where the threat was made that they want reparations for years of abuse by the United States, and nobody's talking about it and they'll end up signing a deal and then we'll get sued for $400 billion or $1 trillion."	0
200001083	TRUMP	All that stuff has to be agreed to now.	0
200001084	TRUMP	We don't want to get sued after the deal is made.	0
200001085	TRUMP	"So I don't agree with President Obama, I do agree something should be - should take place."	0
200001086	TRUMP	"After 50 years, it's enough time, folks."	0
200001087	TRUMP	But we have to make a good deal and we have to get rid of all the litigation that's going to happen.	0
200001088	TRUMP	"This was just a little story but it was a big story to me because I said oh, here we go, we make a deal, then get sued for a tremendous amount of money for reparations."	0
200001089	TRUMP	"So I want to do something, but it's got to be done intelligently."	0
200001090	TRUMP	We have to make good deal.	0
200001091	BASH	"Senator Rubio, I know you want to get in."	0
200001092	BASH	"But just to be clear, Mr. Trump, are you saying that if you were president, you would continue the diplomatic relations or would you reverse them?"	0
200001093	TRUMP	"I would want to make a good deal, I would want to make a strong, solid, good deal because right now, everything is in Cuba's favor."	0
200001094	TRUMP	"Right now, everything, every single aspect of this deal is in Cuba's favor."	0
200001095	TRUMP	It the same way as the Iran deal.	0
200001096	TRUMP	We never walked - we never - all we do is keep giving.	0
200001097	TRUMP	We give and give and give.	0
200001098	BASH	"But Mr. Trump, just to be clear, there is an embassy that you would have to decide whether it would be open or whether you would close it."	0
200001099	BASH	Which would it be?	0
200001100	BASH	In Havana.	0
200001101	TRUMP	I would probably have the embassy closed until such time as a really good deal was made and struck by the United States.	0
200001102	TRUMP	(APPLAUSE)	0
200001103	RUBIO	"All right, first of all, the embassy is the former consulate."	0
200001104	RUBIO	It's the same building.	0
200001105	RUBIO	So it could just go back to being called a consulate.	0
200001106	RUBIO	We don't have to close it that way.	0
200001107	RUBIO	"Second of all, I don't know where Cuba is going to use, but if they sue us in a court in Miami, they're going to lose."	0
200001108	SYSTEM	(LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE)	0
200001109	RUBIO	"Third, on the issue of a good deal, I know what the good deal."	0
200001110	RUBIO	"I'll tell you what the good deal now, it's already codified."	0
200001111	RUBIO	"Here's a good deal - Cuba has free elections, Cuba stops putting people in jail for speaking out, Cuba has freedom of the press, Cuba kicks out the Russians from Lourdes (ph) and kicks out the Chinese listening station in Berupal (ph) Cuba stops helping North Korea evade U.N. sanctions, Cuba takes all of those fugitives of America justice, including that cop killer from New Jersey, and send her back to the United States and to jail where she belongs."	0
200001112	RUBIO	And you know what?	0
200001113	RUBIO	Then we can have a relationship with Cuba.	0
200001114	RUBIO	That's a good deal.	0

200001116	BASH	"Thank you, Senator Rubio."	0
200001117	BASH	"Senator Cruz, if you become president, would you reverse course and once again break diplomatic relations with Cuba?"	0
200001118	CRUZ	"Yes, I would."	0
200001119	CRUZ	"And you know, I think this exchange actually highlights a real choice for Republican primary voters."	0
200001120	CRUZ	"When it comes to foreign policy, do you want to continue on the same basic trajectory as the last seven years of the Obama foreign policy?"	0
200001121	CRUZ	"When it comes to these deals, Cuba and Iran, they were negotiated by Hillary Clinton and John Kerry."	0
200001122	CRUZ	There's a real difference between us.	0
200001123	CRUZ	Donald supported Hillary Clinton and John Kerry.	0
200001124	CRUZ	And what he said right now is that he agrees in principle with what they're doing.	0
200001125	CRUZ	"The only thing he thinks is that they should negotiate a little bit better deals, they should be more effective."	0
200001126	CRUZ	"I have a fundamental disagreement and I think most Republicans and most Americans do, that we shouldn't be allowing billions of dollars to go to nations that hate us to go to Cuba, to go to Iran and to let them use those billions of dollars to try to murder us."	0
200001127	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0

200001130	TRUMP	"Well, if Ted was listening, he would have heard me say something very similar."	0
200001131	TRUMP	I said we would not do the deal unless it was going to be a very good deal for us.	0
200001132	TRUMP	And I think I said it loud and I think I said it very clear.	0
200001133	TRUMP	"And I think after 50 years, and I have many friends, I own many properties in Miami, many, many, and I have many people that know and they feel exactly the way I do, make a deal, it would be great, but it's got to be a great deal for the United States, not a bad deal for the United States."	0
200001134	TRUMP	"As far as Iran is concerned, I would have never made that deal."	0
200001135	TRUMP	"That is one of the worst deals ever, ever made by this country."	0
200001136	TRUMP	It is a disaster.	0
200001137	TRUMP	"So for Ted to say I agree with this deal, I mean, it's a staple in my speeches that that may he worst single deal I've ever seen negotiated."	0
200001138	TRUMP	"So don't try to put it on me like it's wonderful, like I love it."	0
200001139	BASH	"Senator Cruz, your response?"	0
200001140	CRUZ	"Well, look."	0
200001141	CRUZ	"I'll point out first of all it is a matter of public record that Donald supported John Kerry in 2004 over George W. Bush, and he supported Hillary Clinton, gave her two checks in a presidential campaign in 2008."	0
200001142	CRUZ	"And indeed, once she was secretary of State, he described her as one of the greatest secretaries of State in industry."	0
200001143	CRUZ	"And, you know, the point on the Iran deal, his answer to everything is if only if someone smarter were in government, things would be better."	0
200001144	CRUZ	No.	0
200001145	CRUZ	We don't just need smarter people in government.	0

200001149	CRUZ	That reflects you do not understand the radical Islam terrorist that is the Ayatollah that wants to murder us.	0

200001156	TRUMP	If the prisoners don't come back early - three years ago.	0
200001157	TRUMP	"One of the longest negotiations I've ever seen, by the way."	0
200001158	TRUMP	"If they don't come back early, I was saying don't negotiate."	0
200001159	TRUMP	They come back early.	0
200001160	TRUMP	"What you do is you take it back and you say, either give us the prisoners or we double up the sanctions."	0
200001161	TRUMP	What we should have done is doubled up the sanctions and made a much better deal.	0
200001162	TRUMP	Cause that deal is a disaster.	0
200001163	TRUMP	"Ted, the money is largely gone because of incompetent and very, very poor negotiators."	0

200001173	KASICH	"You won't arm the freedom fighters in Ukraine, we let the Russians trump up some excuse in the business of Russian-speaking people."	0
200001174	KASICH	You had a red line in Syria.	0
200001175	KASICH	You walked away from it.	0
200001176	KASICH	"You refused to fund the Syrian rebels, you undercut Egypt and we ended up with the Muslim brotherhood for awhile."	0
200001177	KASICH	And then we turn our back on Netanyahu when he comes to Congress to talk about his concerns of the Iranian deal.	0
200001178	KASICH	"Look, I know in human nature sometimes there's a sense that you make better with your enemies than you do with your friends."	0
200001179	KASICH	And you know what happens when you do that?	0
200001180	KASICH	You make a terrible mistake.	0

200001184	KASICH	"The fact is, they need to understand who we are."	0
200001185	KASICH	The Chinese understand.	0
200001186	KASICH	They don't own the South China Sea.	0
200001187	KASICH	They have to stop hacking everything we have in this country or we'll take out their systems.	0
200001188	KASICH	We will arm the Ukrainians so they have lethal defensive aid.	0
200001189	KASICH	"We will destroy ISIS and Mr. Putin, you better understand, you're either with us or you're against us."	0
200001190	KASICH	We're not rattling a sword.	0
200001191	KASICH	You're not our enemy but we're not going to put up with this nonsense any longer.	0
200001192	KASICH	And a strong America is what the entire world is begging for.	0
200001193	KASICH	Where has America gone is what many of our allies say around the world.	0

200001198	TAPPER	"While we're discussing the issues of importance to Floridians, I reached out to the Republican mayor of Miami, Tomas Regalado, to find out what he wanted to hear from you this evening."	0
200001199	TAPPER	"Mayor Regalado told me, quote, ""Climate change means rising ocean levels, which in south Florida means flooding downtown and in our neighborhoods. It's an every day reality in our city. Will you, as president acknowledge the reality of the scientific consensus about climate change and as president, will you pledge to do something about it?"""	0
200001200	TAPPER	Unquote.	0
200001201	TAPPER	"Senator Rubio, the Miami mayor has endorsed you."	0
200001202	TAPPER	Will you honor his request for a pledge and acknowledge the reality of the scientific consensus of climate change and pledge to do something about it?	0
200001203	RUBIO	"Well, sure if the climate is changing and one of the reasons is because the climate has always been changing."	0
200001204	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
200001205	RUBIO	There's never been a time when the climate has not changed.	0
200001206	RUBIO	"I think the fundamental question for a policy maker is, is the climate changing because of something we are doing and if so, is there a law you can pass to fix it?"	0
200001207	RUBIO	"So on the issue of flooding in Miami, it's caused by two things."	0
200001208	RUBIO	"Number one, south Florida is largely built on land that was once a swamp."	0
200001209	RUBIO	"And number two, because if there is higher sea levels or whatever it may be happening, we do need to deal with that through mitigation."	0
200001210	RUBIO	And I have long supported mitigation efforts.	0
200001211	RUBIO	"But as far as a law that we can pass in Washington to change the weather, there's no such thing."	0
200001212	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
200001213	RUBIO	"On the contrary, there is laws they want us to pass."	0
200001214	RUBIO	There are laws they want to us pass that would be devastating for our economy or these programs like what the president has put in with the Clean Power Act or all these sorts of things that he's forcing down our throats on the war on coal.	0
200001215	RUBIO	Let me tell you who is going to pay the price of that?	0
200001216	RUBIO	Americans are going to pay the price of that.	0
200001217	RUBIO	"The cost of doing that is going to be rammed down the throats of the American consumer, the single parent, the working families who are going to see increases in the cost of living."	0
200001218	RUBIO	The businesses who are going to leave America because it's more expensive to do business here than anywhere else.	0
200001219	RUBIO	And you know what passing those laws would have - what impact it would have on the environment?	0
200001220	RUBIO	"Zero, because China is still going to be polluting and India is still going to be polluting at historic levels."	0
200001221	RUBIO	"So, I am in favor of a clean environment."	0
200001222	RUBIO	My children live in South Florida.	0
200001223	RUBIO	My family is being raised here.	0
200001224	RUBIO	"I want this to be a safe and clean place, but these laws some people are asking us to pass will do nothing for the environment and they will hurt and devastate our economy."	0
200001225	TAPPER	"So just to clarify, Senator Rubio, Mayor Regalado when he talks about the reality of the scientific consensus about climate change, the Republican mayor of Miami, he's saying the scientific consensus is that man does contribute to climate change."	0
200001226	TAPPER	"When you talk to him, because he is the mayor of Miami and he has endorsed you, do you tell him that he's wrong?"	0
200001227	RUBIO	I would say to him that there is no law that they want us to pass that would have any impact on that.	0
200001228	RUBIO	"If we pass - if you took the gift list of all of these groups that are asking us to pass these laws and did every single one of them, there would be no change in our environment."	0
200001229	RUBIO	Sea level would still rise.	0
200001230	RUBIO	All these other things that are happening would continue to go on for a lot of different reasons.	0
200001231	RUBIO	"One, because America is not a planet."	0
200001232	RUBIO	It's a country.	0
200001233	RUBIO	"And number two, because these other countries like India and China are more than making up in carbon emissions for whatever we could possibly cut."	1
200001234	RUBIO	Here's what he will immediately - and Mayor Regalado is a great mayor and a good friend - but here's what he's going to immediately going to start hearing from.	0
200001235	RUBIO	"He will immediately start hearing from families in South Florida who are barely making it by, and now their electric bill went up $20 or $30 a month because we just made it more expensive to generate power."	0
200001236	RUBIO	That cost will be passed on to working families.	0
200001237	RUBIO	I am not going to destroy the U.S. economy for a law that will do nothing for our environent.	0

200001240	KASICH	"Well, I - I do believe we contribute to climate change, but I don't think it has to be a, you know, either you're for some environmental stringent rules or, you know, you're not going to have any jobs."	0
200001241	KASICH	"The fact is, you can have both."	0
200001242	KASICH	"In our state, we've reduced emissions by 30 percent."	0
200001243	KASICH	But let me tell you also what we're trying to do.	0
200001244	KASICH	We want all the sources of energy.	0
200001245	KASICH	"We want to dig coal, but we want to clean it when we burn it."	0
200001246	KASICH	We believe in natural gas.	0
200001247	KASICH	We believe in nuclear power.	0
200001248	KASICH	And you know what else I believe in?	0
200001249	KASICH	"I happen to believe in solar energy, wind energy, efficiency, renewables matter."	0
200001250	KASICH	"Now, it doesn't mean because you pursue a policy of being sensitive to the environment, because we don't know how much humans actually contribute."	0
200001251	KASICH	But it is important we develop renewables.	0
200001252	KASICH	Battery technology can unleash an entirely different world.	0
200001253	KASICH	So the fact is that you can have a strong environmental policy at the same time that you have strong economic growth and they are not inconsistent with one another.	0
200001254	TAPPER	"Thank you, Governor."	0
200001255	TAPPER	"Senator Cruz, I want to talk a little bit right now about how you gentlemen see the world."	0
200001256	TAPPER	"Senator Cruz, Colin Powell this week said that the nasty tone of this presidential election is hurting the image of the U.S. abroad."	0
200001257	TAPPER	"He said, quote, ""foreigners of the world looking at this are distressed."""	0
200001258	TAPPER	Does it matter to you what the rest of the world thinks of the United States?	0
200001259	CRUZ	Of course it does.	0
200001260	CRUZ	"And we've seen for seven years a president that has made the presidency and has made, sadly, his administration a laughing stock in the world."	0
200001261	CRUZ	This administration started with President Obama sending back the bust of Winston Churchill to the United Kingdom within the opening weeks.	0
200001262	CRUZ	Then he proceeded to go on a worldwide apology tour apologizing for the United States of America.	0
200001263	CRUZ	Our friends and allies quickly learned America could not be counted on.	0
200001264	CRUZ	"I'll tell you, when I travel abroad, when I meet with heads of states and defense ministers and foreign ministers, they say over and over again, ""it is hard to be friends with America; we can't count on America; America doesn't stand with us."""	0
200001265	CRUZ	And that is a disgrace.	0
200001266	CRUZ	"But the good news is, Jake, we've seen this before."	0
200001267	CRUZ	"We have seen a weak Democratic president undermine the military, weaken our readiness, weaken our respect in the world with Jimmy Carter."	0
200001268	CRUZ	"And in January 1981, Ronald Reagan came into office and that can change overnight."	0
200001269	CRUZ	It's worth remembering Iran released our hostages the day Ronald Reagan was sworn into office.	0
200001270	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
200001271	CRUZ	"And America needs a president who stands with our friends and allies, as I will do, and who stands up and demonstrates strengths to our enemies."	0

200001276	TAPPER	"When the students poured into Tiananmen Square, the Chinese government almost blew it, then they were vicious, they were horrible, but they put it down with strength."	0
200001277	TAPPER	"Mr. Trump, some of your Republican critics have expressed concern about comments you have made praising authoritarian dictators."	0
200001278	TAPPER	"You have said positive things about Putin as a leader and about China's massacre of pro-democracy protesters at Tiananmen Square, you've said ""That shows you the power of strength."""	0
200001279	TAPPER	How do you respond...	0
200001280	TRUMP	That doesn't mean I was endorsing that.	0
200001281	TRUMP	I was not endorsing it.	0
200001282	TRUMP	"I said that is a strong, powerful government that put it down with strength."	0
200001283	TRUMP	And then they kept down the riot.	0
200001284	TRUMP	It was a horrible thing.	0
200001285	TRUMP	It doesn't mean at all I was endorsing it.	0
200001286	TRUMP	"As far as Putin is concerned, I think Putin has been a very strong leader for Russia."	0
200001287	TRUMP	"I think he has been a lot stronger than our leader, that I can tell you."	0
200001288	TRUMP	"I mean, for Russia, that doesn't mean I'm endorsing Putin."	0
200001289	TAPPER	But the word strong obviously is a compliment...	0
200001290	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
200001291	TAPPER	... and many people would look at what the Chinese leaders have done and what Putin is doing as atrocities.	0
200001292	TRUMP	I used to think Merkel was a great leader until she did what she did to Germany.	0
200001293	TRUMP	Germany is a disaster right now.	0
200001294	TRUMP	So I used to think that.	0
200001295	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
200001296	TRUMP	And strong doesn't mean good.	0
200001297	TRUMP	"Putin is a strong leader, absolutely."	0
200001298	TRUMP	I could name many strong leaders.	0
200001299	TRUMP	I could name very many very weak leaders.	0
200001300	TRUMP	But he is a strong leader.	0
200001301	TRUMP	Now I don't say that in a good way or a bad way.	0
200001302	TRUMP	I say it as a fact.	0
200001303	TAPPER	"Governor Kasich, when you were a member of Congress, you were outspoken about the Tiananmen Square massacre."	0
200001304	TAPPER	What do you think?	0
200001305	KASICH	I think that the Chinese government butchered those kids.	0
200001306	KASICH	"And when that guy stood in front - that young man stood in front of that tank, we ought to build a statue of him over here when he faced down the Chinese government."	0
200001307	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
200001308	KASICH	"Now I will tell you, I don't believe that we need to make China an enemy."	0
200001309	KASICH	They are a competitor.	0
200001310	KASICH	But I want to go back to three things they should do.	0
200001311	KASICH	"We should have the heat on them to work in North Korea to get rid of that guy and the things that he's doing, number one."	0
200001312	KASICH	"Number two, they need to realize they don't own the South China Sea."	0
200001313	KASICH	And I will compliment the administration for sending a carrier battle group into the South China Sea.	0
200001314	KASICH	"And thirdly, when it comes to the issue of cyber attacks, we're going to have to beef up the cyber command."	0
200001315	KASICH	"And they need to understand that if you attack us we will defend ourselves, everything, including our grid."	0
200001316	KASICH	"But if you do it, we have the capability to take out your systems."	0
200001317	KASICH	The president has not given the cyber command that authority.	0
200001318	KASICH	I will.	0
200001319	KASICH	"And when it comes to trade, I will tell you this, they can't manipulate their currency."	0
200001320	KASICH	That will not be anything that I would allow them to get away with.	0
200001321	KASICH	"And if I saw them doing it, I would take immediate action and make sure that the American worker is protected."	0

200001332	TAPPER	This is hardly the first incident of violence breaking out at one of your rallies.	0
200001333	TAPPER	"Today, Hillary Clinton, your potential general election opponent, clearly indicated she sees this as an issue for the campaign."	0

200001336	TRUMP	I hope not.	0
200001337	TRUMP	I truly hope not.	0
200001338	TRUMP	I will say this.	0

200001402	SYSTEM	(BELL RINGS)	0
200001403	TRUMP	It is a disgrace.	0
200001404	TRUMP	It was a total disgrace.	0
200001405	TRUMP	"And I've had reporters, people that you know, come up to me and said that - what they did on the Today Show was a disgrace."	0

200001407	TAPPER	"Governor Kasich, do you worry about the scenes of violence at some of these rallies affecting the Republican party's chances in November?"	0
200001408	KASICH	"Well, I worry about the violence at a rally period."	0
200001409	KASICH	"I mean, it's - you know, elections are important but the unity of this country really matters."	0
200001410	KASICH	"Jake, here's what I think is happening."	0
200001411	KASICH	There are people out there who are worried about their jobs.	0
200001412	KASICH	"They're worried that somebody is going to come in and tell them they're out of work and they're 54 years old and they don't know where they're going to get another job, a man and a woman."	0
200001413	KASICH	Maybe they're worried about a trade deal.	0
200001414	KASICH	They're worried about the fact that their wages haven't gone up.	0
200001415	KASICH	"They're worried that their kids went to college and the promise was, you go to college, you get a job, things are going to be great."	0
200001416	KASICH	"They went to college, they rang up debt and they're still living in their parents' basement."	0
200001417	KASICH	People are uptight.	0
200001418	KASICH	Our seniors are worried they're going to lose their Social Security.	0
200001419	KASICH	There's two ways to treat it.	0
200001420	KASICH	"You can either prey on that and be negative about it, or you tell people that these things can be fixed."	0
200001421	KASICH	"If we're Americans rather than Republicans and Democrats, we get together, we can solve all of these problems."	0

200001428	TAPPER	I know you want to say something.	0
200001429	RUBIO	I do.	0
200001430	RUBIO	A couple of points.	0
200001431	RUBIO	"The first is, I'm concerned about violence in general in this society."	0
200001432	RUBIO	"And by the way, the first people that are facing that violence are our law enforcement officers."	0
200001433	RUBIO	And they deserve our respect and they deserve our thanks for everything they do for us.	0
200001434	RUBIO	On the issue of anger.	0
200001435	RUBIO	"Yes, people are angry."	0
200001436	RUBIO	Of course they're angry.	0
200001437	RUBIO	Every institution in America has been failing us for the better part of 20 years or 30 years.	0
200001438	RUBIO	"But leadership is not about using the anger, leadership is about using the anger to motivate us, not to define us."	0
200001439	RUBIO	But to motivate us to take action.	0
200001440	RUBIO	Being here in Miami is special.	0
200001441	RUBIO	My grandfather lived with us most of his life while I was growing up.	0

200001448	RUBIO	Americans can do anything.	0
200001449	RUBIO	"There is no problem before us we cannot solve and we can solve it if we come together in a serious way, in this generation."	0
200001450	TAPPER	Thank you senator.	0

200001454	TAPPER	"The math suggests that it possible that not one of you will reach the magic number of 1,237 delegates before the Republican convention, which would mean a contested convention."	0
200001455	TAPPER	Let's go back to Salem Radio's Hugh Hewitt.	0
200001456	HEWITT	Thank you Jake.	0
200001457	HEWITT	"Governor Kasich, the math and the maps say that you can only become the nominee if in fact there is a contested convention."	0
200001458	HEWITT	"If we arrive on the shores of Lake Erie, Donald Trump has the most delegates."	0
200001459	HEWITT	"Why shouldn't the person with the most delegates, even if it's not a majority of delegates, be the nominee?"	0
200001460	KASICH	"Well, first of all, let's not - you know, math doesn't tell the whole story in politics."	0
200001461	KASICH	"The great thing about politics, the reason why we watch it is because what's true today is not necessarily true tomorrow."	0
200001462	KASICH	So let's not get ahead of ourselves.	0
200001463	KASICH	"Secondly, look, when you went to school up there in Salem, Ohio, OK."	0
200001464	KASICH	"If you got an 86, you got a B."	0
200001465	KASICH	Because everybody else had an 84 didn't mean you got an A.	0
200001466	KASICH	So you just have to win enough delegates to be the nominee.	0
200001467	KASICH	"And frankly, I don't know if we're going to get a convention like that."	0
200001468	KASICH	"But if we do, I was at one in 1976 as a wee lad and supported Ronald Reagan and actually worked directly with him."	0
200001469	KASICH	He tried valiantly.	0
200001470	KASICH	He lost.	0
200001471	KASICH	Gerald Ford won.	0
200001472	KASICH	The party was united.	0
200001473	KASICH	Gerald Ford served the country great by pardoning Richard Nixon.	0
200001474	KASICH	"He lost the election probably because of that, but he put America first."	0
200001475	KASICH	And we were healed as a party.	0
200001476	KASICH	"So, look, you have to earn the delegates in order to be picked."	0
200001477	KASICH	But let's not get ahead of ourselves.	0
200001478	KASICH	We don't know what's going to happen because we still have about half the delegates to be selected.	0
200001479	KASICH	And that's what's going to be a very interesting thing to see how it all turns out as we move forward over the next couple of weeks.	0

200001483	HEWITT	"And if so, would you support that person?"	0
200001484	TRUMP	"I think that what should happen, getting back maybe a little bit to your first question, I think that whoever - first of all, I think I'm going to have the delegates."	0
200001485	TRUMP	OK?	0
200001486	TRUMP	I think.	0
200001487	TRUMP	Let's see what happens.	0
200001488	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
200001489	TRUMP	"But if somebody doesn't have the delegates, and I guess there's two of us up here that can and there are two of us that cannot at this moment."	0
200001490	TRUMP	"But if - no, that's just - by the way, that is not meant to be a criticism."	0
200001491	TRUMP	That's just a mathematical fact.	0
200001492	TRUMP	OK?	0
200001493	TRUMP	"If two of us get up there, I would say this, if - if Marco, if the governor, if Ted had more votes than me in the form of delegates, I think whoever gets to the top position as opposed to solving that artificial number that was by somebody, which is a very random number, I think that whoever gets the most delegates should win."	0

200001495	HEWITT	"Senator Cruz, if you - if you overtake Donald Trump at the convention, what will you do to take his very passionate supporters and keep them from bolting the convention and sabotaging the fall election?"	0

200001511	CRUZ	That's why the media wants him to be the nominee so much.	0

200001513	CRUZ	We are seeing candidates coming together and uniting.	0

200001538	RUBIO	There's a gentleman here in South Florida who just got out of surgery.	0

200001550	TAPPER	"Thank you, Senator."	0
200001551	TAPPER	Let's send it back to Stephen Dinan of the Washington Times.	0
200001552	TAPPER	Stephen?	0
200001553	DINAN	"Mr. Trump, one of your biggest selling points is that you are largely self-funding your campaign, and you argue your opponents are controlled by their special interest donors."	0
200001554	DINAN	Will you maintain your pledge not to take outside contributions throughout the general election?	0
200001555	TRUMP	I have not made that decision yet.	0
200001556	TRUMP	"I will make a decision on that, but I have not made that decision."	0
200001557	TRUMP	My decision was that I would go through the entire primary season and I have turned down probably $275 million worth.	1
200001558	TRUMP	"I have many, many friends that come up all day long, $5 million, $10 million, I'm turning down money."	0
200001559	TRUMP	I feel sort of foolish to be honest with you.	0
200001560	TRUMP	I don't know if I get any credit for it but I'm self-funding my campaign.	0
200001561	TRUMP	"And other than - and by the way, other than very small donations where people are sending in $200, $15, $20, and we have some of that, but it's not a large amount."	0
200001562	TRUMP	"No, I'm self-funding my campaign, and the reason is that I've been in this business a long time and I was on the other side - until eight months ago I was on the or side."	1
200001563	TRUMP	"I made massive contributions, large contributions to politicians, both Democrats and Republicans."	1
200001564	TRUMP	"I was liked by everybody, which is an important thing."	0
200001565	TRUMP	"I will say this - people control special interests, lobbyists, donors, they make large contributions to politicians and they have total control over those politicians."	0
200001566	TRUMP	I don't want anybody to control me but the people right out there.	0
200001567	TRUMP	And I'm going to do the right thing.	0
200001568	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
200001569	DINAN	"Senator Cruz, I want to come to you."	0
200001570	DINAN	"The vast majority of Republicans, and voters overall, agree with Mr. Trump that candidates are beholden to people and groups who donate to their campaigns."	0
200001571	DINAN	Do you deny that those big donors do have influence?	0
200001572	CRUZ	"Well look, absolutely."	0
200001573	CRUZ	"And one of the things we're so frustrated about is the corruption, what I've called the Washington cartel."	0
200001574	CRUZ	It's career politicians in both parties that get in bed with the lobbyists and special interests.	0
200001575	CRUZ	"And listen, Donald told you for 40 years he's been sitting at that table using his money to buy influence, supporting liberal Democrats like Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, but also supporting the Republican establishment and funding their effort to crush the Tea Party."	0
200001576	CRUZ	"And now his argument is after four decades of being part of that influence buying, after Hillary Clinton spending decades being part of that influence selling, that suddenly he will change."	0
200001577	CRUZ	But the interesting point is tonight he hasn't pointed to a single special interest he's willing to take on.	0
200001578	CRUZ	He didn't take on Wall Street when he supported the TARP bailout in Wall Street.	0
200001579	CRUZ	He won't take on ethanol.	1
200001580	CRUZ	"And my campaign, by contrast, was funded by 1.1 million contributions all over this country."	1
200001581	DINAN	"Thank you, Senator."	0
200001582	DINAN	I want to go to Mr. Trump...	0
200001583	CRUZ	$62 at tedcruz.org.	0
200001584	DINAN	... for a response.	0
200001585	DINAN	"Thank you, Senator."	0
200001586	CRUZ	"That's who you've got to be accountable to, the people."	0
200001587	TRUMP	Ted was given to PACs.	0
200001588	TRUMP	"I mean, PACs - you know, these super PACs are a disaster, by the way, folks."	0
200001589	TRUMP	Very corrupt.	0
200001590	TRUMP	It's going to lead to lots of disasters.	0
200001591	TRUMP	"But Ted has super PACs and you have to look at the people that are giving to those super PACs, number one."	0
200001592	TRUMP	It's very important to do that.	0
200001593	TRUMP	"There is total control of the candidates, I know it better than anybody that probably ever lived."	0
200001594	TRUMP	"And I will tell you this, I know the system far better than anybody else and I know the system is broken."	0
200001595	TRUMP	"And I'm the one, because I know it so well because I was on both sides of it, I was on the other side all my life and I've always made large contributions."	0
200001596	TRUMP	"And frankly, I know the system better than anybody else and I'm the only one up here that's going to be able to fix that system because that system is wrong."	0
200001597	DINAN	"Thank you, Mr. Trump."	0
200001598	DINAN	"Senator Rubio, I want to come to you with a question."	0
200001599	DINAN	"At the last debate, you mocked Mr. Trump for being flexible."	0
200001600	DINAN	"With so much gridlock in Washington, how can you expect to lead the country and get things done if you aren't willing to show flexibility?"	0
200001601	RUBIO	"Well, I think you can be flexible about ideas, you shouldn't be flexible about your principles."	0
200001602	RUBIO	"About when it comes to ideas and working with people, I have a record of having done that."	0
200001603	RUBIO	"Listen, on the issue of higher education, I'm the only one that continually talks about student loan debt because I owed over $100,000 of student loan debt."	0
200001604	RUBIO	So I know this is a major issue.	0
200001605	RUBIO	And all my ideas that deal with higher education are bipartisan.	0
200001606	RUBIO	The VA Accountability Act that I passed I did it on a - on a bipartisan basis.	0
200001607	RUBIO	The sanctions that I helped - that I imposed on Hezbollah I did it on a bipartisan basis.	0
200001608	RUBIO	"The Girls Count Act that deals with human trafficking, we did that on a bipartisan basis."	0
200001609	RUBIO	But I also want to be frank.	0
200001610	RUBIO	There are issues we're going to have to have an election over.	0
200001611	RUBIO	"When it comes to repealing and replaces Obamacare, that's not going to be bipartisan."	0
200001612	RUBIO	"When it comes to reducing the tax burdens on Americans, that's not going to be bipartisan."	0
200001613	RUBIO	"When it comes to shrinking the size of the federal bureaucracy,that's probably not going to be bipartisan."	0
200001614	RUBIO	"There are issues we can work together on and we should, but there are fundamental issues about the proper role of government."	0
200001615	RUBIO	"And on those issues, I will fight anyone who wants to expand government, raise taxes, or weaken our military."	0
200001616	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
200001617	DINAN	All right.	0
200001618	DINAN	"Mr. Trump, I want to give you a chance to respond, but specifically you talked about flexibility and one of the examples you gave was the height of the border fence."	0
200001619	DINAN	What are some of the other issues on which you're willing to show flexibility?	0
200001620	TRUMP	It depends on what comes up.	0
200001621	TRUMP	You never know.	0
200001622	TRUMP	It depends on what comes up.	0
200001623	TRUMP	"Look, look, we had a great president, Ronald Reagan."	0
200001624	TRUMP	"We had Tip O'Neill, speaker."	0
200001625	TRUMP	"And what do we do, we take these two men that are very, very different men, they got along, they had relationships, and they got things, and very beautifully."	0
200001626	TRUMP	Nobody is complaining about the deals that Ronald Reagan made.	0
200001627	TRUMP	And he made it with Tip O'Neill.	0
200001628	TRUMP	"We need to have people get together and work good deals out, good deals out from our standpoint."	0
200001629	TRUMP	"And I'll tell you this, it can be done."	0
200001630	TRUMP	We don't want to continue to watch people signing executive orders because that was not what the Constitution and the brilliant designers of this incredible document had in mind.	0
200001631	TRUMP	"We need people that can make deals and can work, because right now in Washington there's total, absolute gridlock."	0
200001632	DINAN	Thank you.	0
200001633	DINAN	"I want to go to Governor Kasich on this issue of flexibility, sir."	0
200001634	KASICH	"Well, look, my record speaks for itself."	0
200001635	KASICH	What I talk about tonight is not a theory.	0
200001636	KASICH	These are things that I've done.	0
200001637	KASICH	I was there when we reformed the Pentagon on a bipartisan basis to give control to the commanders in the field and force the services to work together.	0
200001638	KASICH	"I was the chief architect, along with Senator Domenici, of the last time we balanced the budget and the first time since we walked on the moon."	0
200001639	KASICH	I was there when I worked on the welfare reform in Washington.	0
200001640	KASICH	"And we got it done and we eliminated the entitlement on welfare,"	0
200001641	KASICH	"I then went to Ohio and took Ohio from a basket case, working in a bipartisan basis to reform many things, including the Cleveland public schools, working with a Democratic mayor."	0
200001642	KASICH	My problem isn't that people don't know this.	0
200001643	KASICH	"They say, well, what does that mean?"	0
200001644	KASICH	Does that mean you're too easy?	0
200001645	KASICH	"Well, let me tell you, when we did the balanced budget, we cut the capital gains tax, we provided a family tax credit, we shrunk the government."	0
200001646	KASICH	"In my state, the state of Ohio, has the smallest government in the state of Ohio in 30 years."	1
200001647	KASICH	Conservative principles will work.	0
200001648	KASICH	But show respect to the other side.	0
200001649	KASICH	"One final thing, in regard to Social Security, we will not get that done alone."	0
200001650	KASICH	We will have to have some responsible Democrats who will come in to fix the problem of Social Security.	0
200001651	KASICH	I know how to do it because I've done it and I'll do it again.	0
200001652	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
200001653	TAPPER	"Thank you, Governor."	0
200001654	TAPPER	We have time for one last break.	0
200001655	TAPPER	We'll be right back after this.	0
200001656	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
200001657	SYSTEM	(COMMERCIAL BREAK)	0
200001658	TAPPER	"And we're back with the Republican presidential debate, just five days before the next primary elections."	0
200001659	TAPPER	It is time now for closing statements.	0
200001660	TAPPER	"Candidates, you will each have one minute."	0
200001661	TAPPER	And we'll start with Governor Kasich.	0
200001662	KASICH	"Well, I'd like to say to all of you, the American people, I have run an unwavering, positive campaign for president of the United States."	0
200001663	KASICH	"I have tried to be positive in such a way as to show my record, my accomplishments, my vision."	0
200001664	KASICH	And I wanted to raise the bar in presidential politics so our kids can take a look at the way you can run for president and you will someday maybe be president of the United States.	0
200001665	KASICH	"Sometimes being positive isn't all that interesting, but it's very interesting to my family, my children and so many supporters that I meet all across the country and I will continue to run a positive campaign."	0
200001666	KASICH	"I can fix the problems in Washington, I've done it before."	0
200001667	KASICH	"And, in fact, I want to turn power, money and influence back to you, the American people, so that you can be in the schools and on the streets fighting drugs and dealing with the issues of poverty."	0
200001668	KASICH	We can do this together.	0
200001669	KASICH	Allow me to take care of the federal issues when I send the power back and the money and the influence to you and you can strengthen our nation and our neighborhoods and our families.	0
200001670	KASICH	That's where the spirit and strength of America is.	0
200001671	KASICH	"But ask the people - my friends in Illinois and of course, my beloved Buckeyes to consider me on Tuesday and, please, let me have your vote."	0
200001672	KASICH	God bless.	0
200001673	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
200001674	TAPPER	Senator Rubio.	0
200001675	RUBIO	"It's great to be here, back at home in Miami."	0
200001676	RUBIO	"It's hard to believe that just two decades ago, my father was just a bartender working in the city."	0
200001677	RUBIO	"And now his son stands on this stage, here, as a candidate for the highest office in the land."	0
200001678	RUBIO	My parents never wanted me to go into politics or in particular or anything else.	0
200001679	RUBIO	They just wanted me to have the opportunity to live out all the dreams they once had for themselves.	0
200001680	RUBIO	And that was possible because America is a special country.	0
200001681	RUBIO	But that was not an accident.	0
200001682	RUBIO	America is great because each generation before us did what needed to be done.	0
200001683	RUBIO	"They solved their problems, they confronted their challenges."	0
200001684	RUBIO	They embraced their opportunities.	0
200001685	RUBIO	"And for over two centuries, each generation has left the next better off."	0
200001686	RUBIO	And now the moment has arrived for our generation to do our part.	0
200001687	RUBIO	"And I'm telling you tonight, if you vote for me, here in Florida and everywhere across this country on Tuesday, when I'm elected president, this generation will do it's part."	0
200001688	RUBIO	"We will do whatever it takes to ensure that our children inherit from us, what we inherited from our parents, the single greatest nation in the history of all of mankind."	0
200001689	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
200001690	TAPPER	Senator Cruz.	0
200001691	CRUZ	"What an incredible nation we have, that the son of a bartender and the son of mailman and the son of a dishwasher and a successful businessman, can all stand on this stage, competing and asking for your support."	0
200001692	CRUZ	"In just a few months, one of us is going to stand on the debate stage with Hillary Clinton."	0
200001693	CRUZ	And the choice we are making today is who will best defend our values?	0
200001694	CRUZ	Who will best defend your values and fight for you?	0
200001695	CRUZ	"I have to tell you, I cannot wait to stand on that stage with Hillary Clinton and say, ""Madam Secretary, you are asking for a third term of a failed administration.  You are asking for millions more to remain in stagnant jobs; for millions more steelworkers to be out of work; for wages to remain low; for young people not to have a future."""	0
200001696	CRUZ	We can do better.	0
200001697	CRUZ	"We can instead repeal Obamacare, abolish the IRS, unleash millions of jobs, defend the Bill of Rights, defend the Second Amendment and religious liberty, stand with our cops and our firefighters and our soldiers, and we can keep America safe."	0
200001698	CRUZ	That's the choice I will put to her this fall.	0
200001699	SYSTEM	(APPLAUSE)	0
200001700	TAPPER	Mr. Trump?	0
200001701	TRUMP	Thank you very much.	0
200001702	TRUMP	The Republican Party has a great chance to embrace millions of people that it's never known before.	0
200001703	TRUMP	They're coming by the millions.	0
200001704	TRUMP	We should seize that opportunity.	0
200001705	TRUMP	These are great people.	0
200001706	TRUMP	These are fantastic people.	0
200001707	TRUMP	These are people that love our country.	0
200001708	TRUMP	These are people that want to see America be great again.	0
200001709	TRUMP	These are people that will win us the election and win it easily.	0
200001710	TRUMP	These are people that once the election is won will be able to put Supreme Court justices up that will do a fabulous job.	0
200001711	TRUMP	"Because let me tell you, if we lose this election, you're going to have three, four or maybe even five justices and this country will never, ever recover."	0
200001712	TRUMP	It will take centuries to recover.	0
200001713	TRUMP	So I just say embrace these millions of people that now for the first time ever love the Republican Party.	0
200001714	TRUMP	And unify.	0
200001715	TRUMP	Be smart and unify.	0

200001717	TAPPER	And that concludes this 12th Republican presidential debate.	0
200001718	TAPPER	"We want to thank the candidates, the Republican National Committee, the University of Miami and, of course, each of you for watching."	0
