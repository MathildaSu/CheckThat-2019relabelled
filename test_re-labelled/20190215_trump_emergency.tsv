600001	TRUMP	"Thank you very much, everybody."	0
600002	TRUMP	"Before we begin, I'd like to just say that we have a large team of very talented people in China."	1
600003	TRUMP	We've had a negotiation going on for about two days.	1
600004	TRUMP	It's going extremely well.	1
600005	TRUMP	"Who knows what that means, because it only matters if we get it done."	0
600006	TRUMP	"But we're very much working very closely with China and President Xi, who I respect a lot."	1
600007	TRUMP	Very good relationship that we have.	0
600008	TRUMP	And we're a lot closer than we ever were in this country with having a real trade deal.	0
600009	TRUMP	"We're covering everything ��� all of the points that people have been talking about for years that said couldn't be done, whether it was theft or anything."	0
6000010	TRUMP	Anything.	0
6000011	TRUMP	The unfairness.	0
6000012	TRUMP	"We've been losing, on average, $375 billion a year with China."	1
6000013	TRUMP	A lot of people think it's $506 billion.	1
6000014	TRUMP	Some people think it's much more than that.	0
6000015	TRUMP	We're going to be leveling the playing field.	0
6000016	TRUMP	The tariffs are hurting China very badly.	1
6000017	TRUMP	They don't want them.	0
6000018	TRUMP	"And frankly, if we can make the deal, it'd be my honor to remove them."	0
6000019	TRUMP	"But otherwise, we're having many billions of dollars pouring into our Treasury."	1
6000020	TRUMP	We've never had that before with China.	1
6000021	TRUMP	It's been very much of a one-way street.	0
6000022	TRUMP	"So, that's happening."	0
6000023	TRUMP	"And the relationship with China is very good, but I think they finally respect our country."	0
6000024	TRUMP	They haven't respected us for a long time.	0
6000025	TRUMP	Not for a long time.	0
6000026	TRUMP	"The UK and the U.S., as you probably have been seeing and hearing, we're agreeing to go forward and preserve our trade agreement."	1
6000027	TRUMP	"You know all of the situation with respect to Brexit, and the complexity and the problems."	0
6000028	TRUMP	"But we have a very good trading relationship with the UK, and that's just been strengthened further."	1
6000029	TRUMP	"So with the UK, we're continuing our trade, and we are going to actually be increasing it very substantially as time goes by."	0
6000030	TRUMP	"We expect that the UK will be very, very substantially increased as it relates to trade with the United States."	0
6000031	TRUMP	"The relationship there, also, is very good."	0
6000032	TRUMP	We have a lot of great announcements having to do with Syria and our success with the eradication of the caliphate.	0
6000033	TRUMP	And that will be announced over the next 24 hours.	0
6000034	TRUMP	And many other things.	0
6000035	TRUMP	A lot of positive things are going on.	0
6000036	TRUMP	We're working on a summit.	0
6000037	TRUMP	And you know all about the summit.	0
6000038	TRUMP	It will be in Vietnam ��� Hanoi.	0
6000039	TRUMP	And we will ��� we'll be meeting in Hanoi.	0
6000040	TRUMP	We'll be meeting in Hanoi.	0
6000041	TRUMP	"I think a lot of you will be going, I suspect."	0
6000042	TRUMP	And I hope we have the same good luck as we had in the first summit.	0
6000043	TRUMP	A lot was done in the first summit.	0
6000044	TRUMP	No more rockets going up.	1
6000045	TRUMP	No more missiles going up.	1
6000046	TRUMP	No more testing of nuclear.	1
6000047	TRUMP	"Get back our remains, the remains of our great heroes from the Korean War."	1
6000048	TRUMP	And we got back our hostages.	1
6000049	TRUMP	But we hope we're going to be very much equally as successful.	0
6000050	TRUMP	I'm in no rush for speed.	0
6000051	TRUMP	We just don't want testing.	0
6000052	TRUMP	"The sanctions, as you know, remain."	0
6000053	TRUMP	Everything is remaining.	0
6000054	TRUMP	"China has been helping us, and Russia has been helping us."	1
6000055	TRUMP	"And South Korea, I think you can say, has been ��� we've been working very closely with South Korea, with Japan."	1
6000056	TRUMP	"But China, Russia, on the border, have really been at least partially living up to what they're supposed to be doing."	0
6000057	TRUMP	And that's okay ��� as per the United Nations.	0
6000058	TRUMP	"So we will have a meeting on the 27th and 28th of February, and I think that will be a very successful one."	0
6000059	TRUMP	I look forward to seeing Chairman Kim.	0
6000060	TRUMP	"We have also established a very good relationship, which has never happened between him or his family and the United States."	1
6000061	TRUMP	They have really taken advantage of the United States.	0
6000062	TRUMP	Billions of dollars has been paid to them.	1
6000063	TRUMP	And we won't let that happen.	0
6000064	TRUMP	"But we think that North Korea and Chairman Kim have a tremendous potential as an economic force, economic power."	0
6000065	TRUMP	Their location between South Korea and then Russia and China ��� right smack in the middle ��� is phenomenal.	0
6000066	TRUMP	And we think that they have a great chance for tremendous economic prosperity in the future.	0
6000067	TRUMP	So I look forward to seeing Chairman Kim in Vietnam.	0
6000068	TRUMP	"Today, I'm announcing several critical actions that my administration has taken to confront a problem that we have right here at home."	0
6000069	TRUMP	"We fight wars that are 6,000 miles away; wars that we should have never been in, in many cases."	0
6000070	TRUMP	But we don't control our own border.	0
6000071	TRUMP	So we're going to confront the national security crisis on our southern border.	0
6000072	TRUMP	"And we're going to do it one way or the other ��� we have to do it ��� not because it was a campaign promise, which it is."	0
6000073	TRUMP	"It was one of many, by the way; not my only one."	0
6000074	TRUMP	"We're rebuilding the military, our economy is thriving like never before."	1
6000075	TRUMP	"You look at other economies ��� they're doing terribly, and we're doing phenomenally."	1
6000076	TRUMP	"The market is up tremendously today, not that that's anything, but, you know ��� because I'll go back in and they'll say, ""Oh, the market just went down."""	1
6000077	TRUMP	But the market is getting close to the new highs that we created.	1
6000078	TRUMP	We have all the records.	0
6000079	TRUMP	We have every record.	0
6000080	TRUMP	But we're getting close to that point again where we'll create new records.	0
6000081	TRUMP	"So our country is doing very well, economically."	1
6000082	TRUMP	And we've done a lot.	0
6000083	TRUMP	"But one of the things I said I have to do and I want to do is border security, because we have tremendous amounts of drugs flowing into our country, much of it coming from the southern border."	1
6000084	TRUMP	"When you look and when you listen to politicians ��� in particular, certain Democrats ��� they say it all comes through the port of entry."	1
6000085	TRUMP	It's wrong.	0
6000086	TRUMP	It's wrong.	0
6000087	TRUMP	It's just a lie.	0
6000088	TRUMP	It's all a lie.	0
6000089	TRUMP	They say walls don't work.	0
6000090	TRUMP	Walls work 100 percent.	1
6000091	TRUMP	"Whether it's El Paso ��� I really was smiling, because the other night I was in El Paso ��� we had a tremendous crowd, and ��� tremendous crowd."	0
6000092	TRUMP	"And I asked the people ��� many of whom were from El Paso, but they came from all over Texas."	0
6000093	TRUMP	And I asked them.	0
6000094	TRUMP	"I said, ""Let me ask you, as a crowd: When the wall went up, was it better?"""	0
6000095	TRUMP	"You were there, some of you."	0
6000096	TRUMP	It was not only better; it was like 100 percent better.	0
6000097	TRUMP	You know what they did.	0
6000098	TRUMP	But that's only one example.	0
6000099	TRUMP	There are so many examples.	0
60000100	TRUMP	"In El Paso, they have close to 2,000 murders right on the other side of the wall."	1
60000101	TRUMP	And they had 23 murders.	1
60000102	TRUMP	"It's a lot of murders, but it's not close to 2,000 murders right on the other side of the wall, in Mexico."	1
60000103	TRUMP	So everyone knows that walls work.	0
60000104	TRUMP	"And there are better examples than El Paso, frankly."	0
60000105	TRUMP	You just take a look.	0
60000106	TRUMP	Almost everywhere.	0
60000107	TRUMP	Take a look at Israel.	0
60000108	TRUMP	They're building another wall.	0
60000109	TRUMP	"Their wall is 99.9 percent effective, they told me ��� 99.9 percent."	1
60000110	TRUMP	"That's what it would be with us, too."	0
60000111	TRUMP	The only weakness is they go to a wall and then they go around the wall.	0
60000112	TRUMP	They go around the wall and in.	0
60000113	TRUMP	Okay?	0
60000114	TRUMP	That's what it is.	0
60000115	TRUMP	It's very simple.	0
60000116	TRUMP	And a big majority of the big drugs ��� the big drug loads ��� don't go through ports of entry.	1
60000117	TRUMP	They can't go through ports of entry.	0
60000118	TRUMP	"You can't take big loads because you have people ��� we have some very capable people; the Border Patrol, law enforcement ��� looking."	0
60000119	TRUMP	You can't take human traffic ��� women and girls ��� you can't take them through ports of entry.	0
60000120	TRUMP	You can't have them tied up in the backseat of a car or a truck or a van.	0
60000121	TRUMP	They open the door.	0
60000122	TRUMP	They look.	0
60000123	TRUMP	They can't see three women with tape on their mouth or three women whose hands are tied.	0
60000124	TRUMP	They go through areas where you have no wall.	0
60000125	TRUMP	Everybody knows that.	0
60000126	TRUMP	Nancy knows it.	0
60000127	TRUMP	Chuck knows it.	0
60000128	TRUMP	They all know it.	0
60000129	TRUMP	It's all a big lie.	0
60000130	TRUMP	It's a big con game.	0
60000131	TRUMP	"You don't have to be very smart to know: You put up a barrier, the people come in, and that's it."	0
60000132	TRUMP	"They can't do anything unless they walk left or right, and they find an area where there's no barrier, and they come into the United States."	0
60000133	TRUMP	Welcome.	0
60000134	TRUMP	We've detained more people.	0
60000135	TRUMP	Our border agents are doing such incredible work.	0
60000136	TRUMP	Our military has been incredible.	0
60000137	TRUMP	We put up barbed wire on top of certain old walls that were there.	0
60000138	TRUMP	We fixed the wall and we loaded it up with barbed wire.	0
60000139	TRUMP	It's very successful.	0
60000140	TRUMP	"But our military has been fantastic, and I want to thank them."	0
60000141	TRUMP	And it's very necessary.	0
60000142	TRUMP	We've broken up two caravans that are on their way.	1
60000143	TRUMP	They just are breaking.	0
60000144	TRUMP	They're in the process of breaking up.	0
60000145	TRUMP	We have another one that we haven't been able to break up yet.	0
60000146	TRUMP	We've been actually working with Mexico much better than ever before.	1
60000147	TRUMP	I want to thank the President.	0
60000148	TRUMP	I want to thank Mexico.	0
60000149	TRUMP	They have their own problems.	0
60000150	TRUMP	"They have the largest number of murders that they've ever had in their history ��� almost 40,000 murders."	1
60000151	TRUMP	Forty thousand.	0
60000152	TRUMP	"And they got to straighten that out, and I think they will."	0
60000153	TRUMP	"But I just want to thank the President, because he's been helping us with these monstrous caravans that have been coming up."	0
60000154	TRUMP	"We had one that it was up to over 15,000 people."	1
60000155	TRUMP	It's largely broken up.	0
60000156	TRUMP	Others have gotten through.	0
60000157	TRUMP	"And, in Tijuana, you have a lot of people staying there."	1
60000158	TRUMP	"If we didn't have the wall up, and if we didn't have the wall secured and strengthened, they would have walked right through; they'd be welcomed to the United States."	0
60000159	TRUMP	One of the things we'd save tremendous ��� just a tremendous amount on would be sending the military.	0
60000160	TRUMP	"If we had a wall, we don't need the military because we'd have a wall."	0
60000161	TRUMP	So I'm going to be signing a national emergency.	0
60000162	TRUMP	And it's been signed many times before.	0
60000163	TRUMP	It's been signed by other Presidents from 1977 or so.	1
60000164	TRUMP	It gave the Presidents the power.	0
60000165	TRUMP	There's rarely been a problem.	0
60000166	TRUMP	They sign it; nobody cares.	0
60000167	TRUMP	I guess they weren't very exciting.	0
60000168	TRUMP	But nobody cares.	0
60000169	TRUMP	"They sign it for far less important things, in some cases, in many cases."	0
60000170	TRUMP	"We're talking about an invasion of our country with drugs, with human traffickers, with all types of criminals and gangs."	0
60000171	TRUMP	We have some of the greatest people I know.	0
60000172	TRUMP	They've been with me from the beginning of my campaign ��� almost from the first week.	0
60000173	TRUMP	The Angel Moms.	0
60000174	TRUMP	"Unfortunately, we have new Angel Moms."	0
60000175	TRUMP	"One incredible woman just showed me her daughter who ��� we're talking about killed, in the year of '18."	0
60000176	TRUMP	"I said, ""I haven't seen you before."""	0
60000177	TRUMP	"She said, ""No, I'm new."""	0
60000178	TRUMP	"I said, ""That's too bad."""	0
60000179	TRUMP	It's too bad.	0
60000180	TRUMP	It's so sad.	0
60000181	TRUMP	"Stand up, just for a second."	0
60000182	TRUMP	Show how beautiful your girl was.	0
60000183	TRUMP	Thank you.	0
60000184	TRUMP	I have such respect for these people.	0
60000185	TRUMP	"Angel Moms, Angel Dads, Angel Families."	0
60000186	TRUMP	I have great respect for these people.	0
60000187	TRUMP	These are great people.	0
60000188	TRUMP	These are great people.	0
60000189	TRUMP	They're fighting for their children that have been killed by people that were illegally in this country.	0
60000190	TRUMP	"And the press doesn't cover them; they don't want to, incredibly."	1
60000191	TRUMP	And they're not treated the way they should be.	0
60000192	TRUMP	They're fighting for other people because they don't want what happened to their children or husband or anybody.	0
60000193	TRUMP	"We have one young lady whose husband ��� please, stand up."	0
60000194	TRUMP	Your husband was just killed in Maryland.	0
60000195	TRUMP	Incredible man.	0
60000196	TRUMP	Just killed.	0
60000197	TRUMP	Beautiful children ��� won't be seeing their father again.	0
60000198	TRUMP	These are brave people.	0
60000199	TRUMP	These are people that ��� they don't have to be here.	0
60000200	TRUMP	They don't have to be doing this.	0
60000201	TRUMP	They're doing it for other people.	0
60000202	TRUMP	"So I just want to thank all of you for being here, okay?"	0
60000203	TRUMP	I really do.	0
60000204	TRUMP	I want to thank you.	0
60000205	TRUMP	Incredible people.	0
60000206	TRUMP	"Last year, 70,000 Americans were killed, at least ��� I think the number is ridiculously low ��� by drugs, including meth and heroin and cocaine, fentanyl."	1
60000207	TRUMP	"And one of the things that I did with President Xi in China, when I met him in Argentina at a summit ��� before I even started talking about the trade ��� it was a trade meeting."	0
60000208	TRUMP	"It went very well, but before I talked about trade, I talked about something more important."	0
60000209	TRUMP	"I said, ""Listen, we have tremendous amounts of fentanyl coming into our country. It kills tens of thousands of people ��� I think far more than anybody registers. And I'd love you to declare it a lethal drug and put it on your criminal list."""	0
60000210	TRUMP	And their criminal list is much tougher than our criminal list.	0
60000211	TRUMP	Their criminal list ��� a drug dealer gets a thing called the death penalty.	0
60000212	TRUMP	"Our criminal list, a drug dealer gets a thing called, ""How about a fine?"""	0
60000213	TRUMP	"And when I asked President Xi, I said, ""Do you have a drug problem?"""	0
60000214	TRUMP	"No, no, no. I said, ""You have 1.4 billion people. What do you mean you have no drug problem?"""	0
60000215	TRUMP	"No, we don't have a drug problem.  I said, ""Why?"" ""Death penalty. We give death penalty to people that sell drugs."""	0
60000216	TRUMP	End of problem.	0
60000217	TRUMP	What do we do?	0
60000218	TRUMP	We set up blue ribbon committees.	1
60000219	TRUMP	"Lovely men and women ��� they sit around a table, they have lunch, they eat, they dine, and they waste a lot of time."	0
60000220	TRUMP	"So if we want to get smart, we can get smart."	0
60000221	TRUMP	You can end the drug problem.	0
60000222	TRUMP	You can end it a lot faster than you think.	0
60000223	TRUMP	"But President Xi has agreed to put fentanyl on his list of deadly, deadly drugs."	1
60000224	TRUMP	And it's a criminal penalty.	0
60000225	TRUMP	And the penalty is death.	1
60000226	TRUMP	"So that's, frankly, one of the things I'm most excited about in our trade deal, if you want to know the truth."	0
60000227	TRUMP	I think maybe there's no more important point.	0
60000228	TRUMP	We're going to make billions of dollars with this trade deal.	0
60000229	TRUMP	"It's going to be great for our country and great for China, I hope."	0
60000230	TRUMP	Their market is down close to 40 percent.	1
60000231	TRUMP	Our market is way up.	0
60000232	TRUMP	"We've picked up, since my election, trillions of dollars of worth."	1
60000233	TRUMP	Trillions.	0
60000234	TRUMP	Many trillions.	0
60000235	TRUMP	And China has lost trillions of dollars.	1
60000236	TRUMP	But I want it to be good for China and I want it to be good for the United States.	0
60000237	TRUMP	So we'll see what happens.	0
60000238	TRUMP	"China is coming here next week, by the way."	0
60000239	TRUMP	"They're coming home, the traders."	0
60000240	TRUMP	And then China is coming here next week.	0
60000241	TRUMP	And then I'll be meeting with President Xi at some point after that to maybe ��� for some remaining deals.	0
60000242	TRUMP	"We'll make them directly, one-on-one, ourselves."	0
60000243	TRUMP	"So, we're going to be signing today, and registering, national emergency."	0
60000244	TRUMP	"And it's a great thing to do because we have an invasion of drugs, invasion of gangs, invasion of people, and it's unacceptable."	0
60000245	TRUMP	"And by signing the national emergency ��� something signed many times by other Presidents ��� many, many times."	0
60000246	TRUMP	"President Obama ��� in fact, we may be using one of the national emergencies that he signed, having to do with cartels."	0
60000247	TRUMP	Criminal cartels.	0
60000248	TRUMP	It's a very good emergency that he signed.	0
60000249	TRUMP	And we're going to use parts of it in our dealings on cartels.	0
60000250	TRUMP	So that would be a second national emergency.	0
60000251	TRUMP	"But, in that case, it's already in place."	0
60000252	TRUMP	And what we want ��� really want to do ��� is simple.	0
60000253	TRUMP	It's not like it's complicated.	0
60000254	TRUMP	It's very simple: We want to stop drugs from coming into our country.	0
60000255	TRUMP	We want to stop criminals and gangs from coming into our country.	0
60000256	TRUMP	Nobody has done the job that we've ever done.	0
60000257	TRUMP	"I mean, nobody has done the job that we've done on the border."	1
60000258	TRUMP	"And in a way, what I did by creating such a great economy ��� and if the opposing party got in, this economy would be down the tubes."	0
60000259	TRUMP	"You know, I hear a lot of people say, ""Oh, well. But maybe the previous administration��_"""	0
60000260	TRUMP	"Let me tell you, the previous administration, it was heading south, and it was going fast."	0
60000261	TRUMP	We would have been down the tubes.	0
60000262	TRUMP	The regulations were strangling our country.	0
60000263	TRUMP	Unnecessary regulations.	0
60000264	TRUMP	By creating such a strong economy ��� you just look at your televisions or see what's going on today; it's through the roof.	0
60000265	TRUMP	"What happens is more people want to come, so we have far more people trying to get into our country today than probably we've ever had before."	1
60000266	TRUMP	"And we've done an incredible job in stopping them, but it's a massive number of people."	0
60000267	TRUMP	"If we had the wall, it would be very easy."	0
60000268	TRUMP	We would make up for the cost of the wall just in the cost of the fact that I would be able to have fewer people.	1
60000269	TRUMP	"We wouldn't need all of this incredible talent, some of whom are sitting in the first row."	0
60000270	TRUMP	You wouldn't need all of this incredible talent.	0
60000271	TRUMP	"We would get ��� we would get thousands of law enforcement people, including Border Patrol."	0
60000272	TRUMP	"You put them in different areas, you have them doing different things."	0
60000273	TRUMP	Law enforcement and Border Patrol.	0
60000274	TRUMP	"And I want to thank law enforcement, and I want to thank Border Patrol, and I want to thank ICE."	0
60000275	TRUMP	ICE is abused by the press and by the Democrats.	1
60000276	TRUMP	"And, by the way, we're going to be taking care of ICE."	0
60000277	TRUMP	"You know, we talk about the new bill."	0
60000278	TRUMP	We're going to be taking care of ICE.	0
60000279	TRUMP	They wanted to get rid of ICE.	1
60000280	TRUMP	And the bill is just the opposite of that.	1
60000281	TRUMP	A lot of good things happened.	0
60000282	TRUMP	"So, that's the story."	0
60000283	TRUMP	We want to have a safe country.	0
60000284	TRUMP	"I ran on a very simple slogan: ""Make America Great Again."""	0
60000285	TRUMP	"If you're going to have drugs pouring across the border, if you're going to have human traffickers pouring across the border in areas where we have no protection, in areas where we don't have a barrier, then very hard to make America great again."	0
60000286	TRUMP	"But we've done a fantastic job, but we haven't been given the equipment."	0
60000287	TRUMP	We haven't been given the walls.	0
60000288	TRUMP	"And in the bill, by the way, they didn't even fight us on most of the stuff."	0
60000289	TRUMP	Ports of entry.	0
60000290	TRUMP	"We have so much money, we don't know what to do with it."	0
60000291	TRUMP	I don't know what to do with all the money they're giving us.	0
60000292	TRUMP	It's crazy.	0
60000293	TRUMP	"The only place they don't want to give as much money ��� $1,375,000,000."	0
60000294	TRUMP	"Sounds like a lot, but it's not so much, although we're putting it to much better use than it used to be."	0
60000295	TRUMP	"A lot of the past administrations, they had ��� it was easy to get, and they didn't build or they didn't do what they could have done."	0
60000296	TRUMP	It would have been great.	0
60000297	TRUMP	"It would have been great to have done it earlier, but I was a little new to the job, a little new to the profession."	0
60000298	TRUMP	And we had a little disappointment for the first year and a half.	0
60000299	TRUMP	People that should have stepped up did not step up.	0
60000300	TRUMP	"They didn't step up, and they should have."	0
60000301	TRUMP	Would have been easy.	0
60000302	TRUMP	"Not that easy, but it would have been a lot easier."	0
60000303	TRUMP	But some people didn't step up.	0
60000304	TRUMP	But we're stepping up now.	0
60000305	TRUMP	So we have a chance of getting close to $8 billion.	1
60000306	TRUMP	"Whether it's $8 billion or $2 billion or $1.5 billion, it's going to build a lot of wall."	1
60000307	TRUMP	We're getting it done.	0
60000308	TRUMP	We're right now in construction with wall in some of the most important areas.	1
60000309	TRUMP	"And we have renovated a tremendous amount of wall, making it just as good as new."	1
60000310	TRUMP	That's where a lot of the money has been spent ��� on renovation.	0
60000311	TRUMP	"In fact, we were restricted to renovating, which is okay."	0
60000312	TRUMP	But we're going to run out of areas that we can renovate pretty soon.	0
60000313	TRUMP	So ��� and we need new wall.	0
60000314	TRUMP	So I want to thank everybody for being here.	0
60000315	TRUMP	"I want to thank, in particular, the Angel Moms and Dads for being here."	0
60000316	TRUMP	Thank you very much.	0
60000317	TRUMP	We have great respect for you.	0
60000318	TRUMP	"The real country, our real country ��� the people that really love our country, they love you."	0
60000319	TRUMP	So I just want you to know that.	0
60000320	TRUMP	I know how hard you fight and I know how hard a fight you're having.	0
60000321	TRUMP	I also want to thank all of the law enforcement for the job you do.	0
60000322	TRUMP	"Believe me, our country loves you and they respect you greatly."	0
60000323	TRUMP	And we're giving you a lot of surplus.	0
60000324	TRUMP	"We're giving you surplus military equipment, which a lot of people didn't like giving, previous to this administration."	1
60000325	TRUMP	But hundreds of millions of dollars of surplus equipment.	1
60000326	TRUMP	"And as we get it, as you know, we send it down."	0
60000327	TRUMP	And you have much better protection.	0
60000328	TRUMP	But I really appreciate you being here.	0
60000329	TRUMP	So the order is signed.	1
60000330	TRUMP	And I'll sign the final papers as soon as I get into the Oval Office.	0
60000331	TRUMP	"And we will have a national emergency, and then we will then be sued, and they will sue us in the Ninth Circuit, even though it shouldn't be there."	1
60000332	TRUMP	"And we will possibly get a bad ruling, and then we'll get another bad ruling."	0
60000333	TRUMP	"And then we'll end up in the Supreme Court, and hopefully we'll get a fair shake."	0
60000334	TRUMP	"And we'll win in the Supreme Court, just like the ban."	0
60000335	TRUMP	"They sued us in the Ninth Circuit, and we lost, and then we lost in the appellate division, and then we went to the Supreme Court, and we won."	0
60000336	TRUMP	"And it was very interesting, because yesterday they were talking about the ban."	0
60000337	TRUMP	Because we have a ban.	0
60000338	TRUMP	It's very helpful.	0
60000339	TRUMP	"Madam Secretary, is that right?"	0
60000340	TRUMP	"Without the ban, we'd have a bigger problem."	0
60000341	TRUMP	"We have a ban on certain areas, certain countries, depending on what's going on in the world."	0
60000342	TRUMP	And we won.	0
60000343	TRUMP	"But somebody said, ""President Trump lost on the ban."""	0
60000344	TRUMP	"Well, he was right; I lost at the lower court."	0
60000345	TRUMP	He ��� he didn't say that we ultimately won at the United States Supreme Court.	1
60000346	TRUMP	They didn't want to say that.	0
60000347	TRUMP	They didn't want to go that far.	0
60000348	TRUMP	They were saying how I lost.	0
60000349	TRUMP	"The person sitting right up here ��� ""Donald Trump lost on the ban."""	0
60000350	TRUMP	"Yeah, I did."	0
60000351	TRUMP	"And then I lost a second time; you should have said that, too."	0
60000352	TRUMP	And then it went to the Supreme Court and I won.	1
60000353	TRUMP	Didn't want to take it that far.	0
60000354	TRUMP	"But we won on the ban and we won on other things, too."	1
60000355	TRUMP	"The probably easiest one to win is on declaring a national emergency, because we're declaring it for virtual invasion purposes: drugs, traffickers, and gangs."	0
60000356	TRUMP	"And one of the things, just to finish: We have removed thousands of MS-13 gang monsters."	1
60000357	TRUMP	Thousands.	0
60000358	TRUMP	They're out of this country.	0
60000359	TRUMP	We take them out by the thousands.	1
60000360	TRUMP	And they are monsters.	0
60000361	TRUMP	Okay.	0
60000362	TRUMP	Do you have any questions?	0

60000369	QUESTION	"Mr. President, a lot of the money ���"	0
60000370	TRUMP	Were you saying I was prepared?	0
60000371	QUESTION	With the microphone and prepared for questions.	0
60000372	TRUMP	"Oh, I thought you meant I was prepared."	0
60000373	TRUMP	I couldn't believe you said that.	0

60000376	QUESTION	(LAUGHTER)	0

60000380	TRUMP	I'm always prepared.	0
60000381	QUESTION	A lot of the money that goes to count toward your $8 billion is money that's being reprogrammed in the DOD budget.	1
60000382	QUESTION	"How can you guarantee to military families and to our men and women of the military that none of the money that would be reprogrammed to a wall will take away from other technology, other renovations, construction that is desperately needed in our military?"	0
60000383	TRUMP	Yeah.	0
60000384	TRUMP	"So, John, we had certain funds that are being used at the discretion of generals, at the discretion of the military."	0
60000385	TRUMP	"Some of them haven't been allocated yet, and some of the generals think that this is more important."	0
60000386	TRUMP	I was speaking to a couple of them.	0
60000387	TRUMP	They think this is far more important than what they were going to use it for.	0
60000388	TRUMP	"I said, ""What were you going to use it for?"""	0
60000389	TRUMP	"And I won't go into details, but it didn't sound too important to me."	0
60000390	TRUMP	"Plus, if you think, I've gotten $700 billion for the military in year one, and then last year, $716 billion."	1
60000391	TRUMP	"And we're rebuilding our military, but we have a lot."	0
60000392	TRUMP	"And under the previous administration, our military was depleted ��� badly depleted."	0
60000393	TRUMP	"And they weren't spending ��� I mean, they had a much less ��� they had a much smaller amount of money."	1
60000394	TRUMP	"So when I got $700 billion, and then $716 billion ��� and this year, it's going to be pretty big too, because there's few things more important than our military."	0
60000395	TRUMP	"You know, I'm a big deficit believer and all of that, but before we really start focusing on certain things, we have to build up our military."	0
60000396	TRUMP	It was very badly depleted.	0
60000397	TRUMP	"And we're buying all new jetfighters, all new missiles, all new defensive equipment."	0
60000398	TRUMP	We have ��� we'll soon have a military like we've never had before.	0
60000399	TRUMP	"But when you think about the kind of numbers you're talking about ��� so you have $700 billion, $716 billion ��� when I need $2 billion, $3 billion of out that for a wall ��� which is a very important instrument, very important for the military because of the drugs that pour in."	0
60000400	TRUMP	"And as you know, we have specific rules and regulations where they have drugs, and what you can do in order to stop drugs."	0
60000401	TRUMP	"And that's part of it, too."	0
60000402	TRUMP	We're taking a lot of money from that realm also.	0
60000403	TRUMP	"But when you have that kind of money going into the military, this is a very, very small amount that we're asking for."	0
60000404	TRUMP	"Yeah, go ahead."	0
60000405	TRUMP	Go ahead.	0
60000406	TRUMP	ABC.	0

60000409	TRUMP	"Come on, ABC."	0
60000410	TRUMP	Not much.	0
60000411	TRUMP	Pretty close.	0
60000412	QUESTION	"Mr. President, what do you say to those, including some of your Republican allies, who say that you are violating the Constitution with this move and setting a bad precedent that will be abused by possibly Democratic Presidents in the future?"	0
60000413	QUESTION	Marco Rubio has made this point.	0
60000414	TRUMP	"Well, not too many people."	0
60000415	TRUMP	Yeah.	0
60000416	TRUMP	Not too many people have said that.	0
60000417	TRUMP	But the courts will determine that.	0
60000418	TRUMP	"Look, I expect to be sued."	0
60000419	TRUMP	I shouldn't be sued.	0
60000420	TRUMP	Very rarely do you get sued when you do national emergency.	1
60000421	TRUMP	"And then other people say, ""Oh, if you use it for this, now what are we using it for?"""	0
60000422	TRUMP	We got to get rid of drugs and gangs and people.	0
60000423	TRUMP	It's an invasion.	0
60000424	TRUMP	"We have an invasion of drugs and criminals coming into our country that we stop, but it's very hard to stop."	0
60000425	TRUMP	"With a wall, it would be very easy."	0
60000426	TRUMP	So I think that we will be very successful in court.	0
60000427	TRUMP	I think it's clear.	0
60000428	TRUMP	"And the people that say we create precedent ��� well, what do you have?"	0
60000429	TRUMP	Fifty-six?	0
60000430	TRUMP	"There are a lot of times ��� well, that's creating precedent."	0
60000431	TRUMP	And many of those are far less important than having a border.	0
60000432	TRUMP	"If you don't have a border, you don't have a country."	0
60000433	TRUMP	"You know, we fight ��� before I got here ��� we fight all over the world to create borders for countries, but we don't create a border for our own country."	0
60000434	TRUMP	"So I think what will happen is, sadly, we'll be sued, and sadly, it'll go through a process."	0
60000435	TRUMP	"And, happily, we'll win ��� I think."	0
60000436	TRUMP	Go ahead.	0
60000437	TRUMP	Let's go.	0

60000444	TRUMP	No.	0
60000445	TRUMP	"Look, I went through Congress."	1
60000446	TRUMP	I made a deal.	0

60000464	TRUMP	"And this is one of the ways they think they can possibly win, is by obstruction and a lot of other nonsense."	0

60000473	TRUMP	"Well, you know, you're talking to the wrong person, because I happen to like tariffs, okay?"	0
60000474	TRUMP	"I mean, we're taking in billions and billions of dollars in tariffs from China."	1
60000475	TRUMP	"And our steel industry now, as an example, we tax dumped steel ��� much of it comes from China ��� at 25 percent."	1
60000476	TRUMP	"Our steel industry is so vibrant now again, they're building plants all over the United States."	1
